# STAT345-Final


## For this project, our goal was to gather song data, and then analyze the song lyrics for repetitiveness in various ways.
### To start, we scraped Billboard Top 100 song data off of Wikipedia and created a data frame with some basic information about each song. We then used the data frame of songs to write a function to gather corresponding lyrics from the lyric hosting website www.songlyrics.com. Once we had our cleaned-up data frame of song information, we were then able to create functions that measure receptiveness and visualize our results through multiple graphical visuals. We mainly looked at songs for Country and Hip Hop.
### Our main areas of interest included: 
#### • Unqiue Words Ratio
#### • Title Repetition
#### • Proportion of Songs Containing Themes Across Genres
