"great balls of fire","jerry lee lewis","1958","Country","You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain
Too much love drives a man insane
You broke my will, oh what a thrill
Goodness gracious great balls of fire
I learned to love all of Hollywood money
You came along and you moved me honey
I changed my mind, looking fine
Goodness gracious great balls of fire
You kissed me baby, woo, it feels good
Hold me baby, I wanna love you like a lover should
You're fine, so kind I'm gonna tell this world that your mine mine mine mine
I chew my nails and I twiddle my thumbs
I'm really nervous but it sure is fun
Come on baby, you drive me crazy

"the story of my life","marty robbins","1958","Country","Someday I'm going to write
The story of my life
I'll tell about the night we met
And how my heart can't forget
The way you smiled at me
I want the world to know
The story of my life
About the night your lips met mine
And that first exciting time
I held you close to me
The sorrow in our love was breakin' up
The mem'ry of a broken heart
But later on, the joy of makin' up
Never never more to part
There's one thing left to do
Before my story's through
I've got to take you for my wife
So the story of my life
Can start and end with you
The sorrow in our love was breakin' up
The mem'ry of a broken heart
But later on, the joy of makin' up
Never never more to part
There's one thing left to do
Before my story's through
I've got to take you for my wife
So the story of my life
Can start and end
Can start and end
Can start and end with you"
"ballad of a teenage queen","johnny cash","1958","Country","There's a story in our town
Of the prettiest girl around
Golden hair and eyes of blue
How those eyes could flash at you
(How those eyes could flash at you)
Boys hung 'round her by the score
But she loved the boy next door
Who worked at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen, prettiest girl we've ever seen)
She was queen of the senior prom
She could cook just like her mom
She had everything at sea
Pure delight, this teenage queen
(Pure delight, this teenage queen)
Other boys could offer more
But she loved the boy next door
Who worked at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen, you should be a movie queen)
He would marry her next spring
Saved his money, bought a ring
Then one day, a movie scout
Came to town to take her out
(Came to town to take her out)
Hollywood could offer more
So she left the boy next door
Who worked at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen, see you on the movie screen)
Very soon she was a star
Pretty house and shiny cars
Swimming pool and a fence around
But she missed her old home town
(But she missed her old home town)
All the world was at her door
All except the boy next door
Who worked at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen, saddest girl we've ever seen)
Then one day this teenage star
Sold her house and all her cars
Gave up all her wealth and fame
Left it all and caught a train
(Left it all and caught a train)
Next day, she was at the door
Of the lonely boy next door
Who works at the candy store
(Now this story has some more, you'll hear it all at the candy store)"
"oh lonesome me","don gibson","1958","Country","Everybody's going out and having fun
I'm just a fool for staying home and having none
I can't get over how she set, set me free
Oh, lonesome me
A bad mistake I'm making by just hanging round
I know that I should have some fun and paint the town
A lovesick fool is blind and just can't see
Oh, lonesome me
I'll bet she's not like me she's out and fancy free
She's flirtin' with the boys with all her charms
But I still love her so and brother don't you know
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms
Well, there must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about the past and find somebody new
I've thought of everything from A to Z

City Lights
Ray Price
City Lights
A bright array of city lights as far as I can see,
The great white wave shines through the night for lonely guys like me.
The cabarets and honky-tonks there flashing signs invite A broken heart to lose itself in the glow of city lights.
Lights that say forget her name and a glass of sherry wine Lights that offer other girls for empty hearts like mine.
They paint a pretty picture of a world that’s gay and bright, But it's just a mask for loneliness behind those city lights.
The world was dark and god made stars to brighten up the night,But god who put the stars above I don't believe made those lights.
For it's just a place for men to cry when things don't turn out right. Just a place to run away and hide behind those city lights.
Lights that say forget her love in a different atmosphere, Lights that lure are nothing but a masquerade for tears.
They paint a pretty picture but my arms can't hold her tight, And I just can't say I love to a street of city lights."

Billy, Billy Bayou, watch what you say

Billy was a boy, kinda big for his size
Red hair, freckles and big blue eyes
Thirteen years from the day he was born
Billy fought the battle of the Little Big Horn

One day in eighteen seventy-eight

He wound up married 'cuz he didn't either one

"don't take your guns to town","johnny cash","1959","Country","A young cowboy named Billy Joe grew restless on the farm
A boy filled with wanderlust who really meant no harm
He changed his clothes and shined his boots and combed his dark hair down

Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town
He laughed and kissed his mom and said, ""your Billy Joe's a man""
I can shoot as quick and straight as anybody can
But I wouldn't shoot without a cause; I'd gun nobody down""
But she cried again as he rode away
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town
He sang a song as on he rode his guns hung at his hips
He rode into a cattle town, a smile upon his lips
He stopped and walked into a bar and laid his money down
But his mother's words echoed again
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town
He drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hand
And tried to tell himself at last he had become a man
A dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down
And he heard again his mothers words
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town
Filled with rage then Billy Joe reached for his gun to draw
But the stranger drew his gun and fired before he even saw
As Billy Joe fell to the floor, the crowd all gathered 'round
And wondered at his final words
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town"
"when it's springtime in alaska it's forty below","johnny horton","1959","Country","I mushed from Port Barren through a blizzard of snow
Been out prospecting for two years or so
Pulled into Fairbanks the city was a boon
So I took a little stroll to the Red Dog Saloon
As I walked in the door the music was clear
The prettiest voice I had heard in two years
The song she was singin' made a man's blood run cold
When it's springtime in Alaska it's forty below
(When it's springtime in Alaska it's forty below)
It was Red Headed Lil who was singin' so sweet
I reached down and took the snow packs off my feet
I reached for the gal who was singin' the tune
We did the Eskimo hop all around the saloon
Where the caribou crawl and the grizzly bear hug
We did our dance on a Kodiak rug
The song she kept singing made a man's blood run cold
When it's springtime in Alaska it's forty below
I was as innocent as I could be, I didn't know Lil was big Ed's wife to be
He took out his knife and he gave it a throw
When it's springtime in Alaska I'll be six feet below
(When it's springtime in Alaska he'll be six feet below)"

(banjo intro)
In 1814 we took a little trip
Along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans
And we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans
We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
(One-two-three, with a-one-two-three)
We looked down a river
(Hut-two)
And we see'd the British come
(Three-four)
And there must have been a hundred of'em
(Hut-two)
Beatin' on the drums
(Three-four)
They stepped so high
(Hut-two)
And they made their bugles ring
(Three-four)
We stood by our cotton bales
(Hut-two)
And didn't say a thing
(Two-three-four)
We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
Old Hickory said we could take 'em by surprise
(One-hut, two-three-four)
If we didn't fire our muskets
(One-hut, two-three-four)
'Till we looked 'em in the eye
(One-hut, two-three-four)
We held our fire
(Hut, two-three-four)
'Till we see'd their faces well
Then we opened up our squirrel guns
And really gave 'em - well we
Fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
Yeah, they ran through the briars
(One-hup-two)
And they ran through the brambles
(Hup-two-three-four)
And they ran through the bushes
(Hup-two)
Where the rabbit couldn't go
(Hup-two-three-four)
They ran so fast
(Hup-two)
That the hounds couldn't catch 'em
(One-two-three-four)
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
(One-two, hup-two-three-four)
We fired our cannon 'til the barrel melted down
So we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round
We filled his head with cannon balls, and powdered his behind
And when we touched the powder off the gator lost his mind
We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
Yeah, they ran through the briars

"the three bells","the browns","1959","Country","There's a village hidden deep in the valley
Among the pine trees half forlorn
And there on a sunny morning
Little Jimmy Brown was born
All the chapel bells were ringing
In the little valley town
And the songs that they were singing
Were for baby Jimmy Brown
Then the little congregation
Prayed for guidance from above
Lead us not into temptation,
Bless this hour of meditation
Guide him with eternal love
There's a village hidden deep in the valley
Beneath the mountains high above
And there, twenty years thereafter
Jimmy was to meet his love
All the chapel bells were ringing,
Was a great day in his life
Cause the songs that they were singing
Were for Jimmy and his wife
Then the little congregation
Prayed for guidance from above
Lead us not into temptation,
Bless oh Lord this celebration
May their lives be filled with love
From the village hidden deep in the valley
One rainy morning dark and gray
A soul winged its way to heaven
Jimmy Brown had passed away
Just a lonely bell was ringing
In the little valley town
Twas farewell that it was singing
To our good old Jimmy Brown
And the little congregation
Prayed for guidance from above
Lead us not into temptation,
May his soul find the salvation
Of thy great eternal love"""

I met you my country girl
You didn't have a thing

You were learning fine
Then one day you learned too much
And it poisoned your sweet mind.
Now you've gone and left me
You're with somebody new
But I wonder if you told him
I bought the clothes on you.
When you two are dancin'
And you whisper soft and sweet
I wonder if you tell him
I bought the shoes on your feet.

Now I've lost my country girl
To a city love affair
He'd built you up, you fell for him
You didn't treat me fair.
You think that he's a dream come true
He says he loves you so
But wait until the word gets out
I taught you all that you know.
Now you've gone and left me

"el paso","marty robbins","1959","Country","Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Night-time would find me in Rosa's cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl
Blacker than night were the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden
I was in love but in vain, I could tell
One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring
A drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina
The girl that I loved
So in anger I
Challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heart-beat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor
Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run
Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I caught a good one
It looked like it could run
Up on its back
And away I did ride
Just as fast as I
Could from the West Texas town of El Paso
Out to the bad-lands of New Mexico
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in lifenothing is left
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death
I saddled up and away I did go
Riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow
A bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this
Pain in my heart
And at last here I
Am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I go
Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting I can't let them catch me
I have to make it to Rosa's back door
Something is dreadfully wrong for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
Though I am trying
To stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary
Unable to ride
But my love for
Felina is strong and I rise where I've fallen
Though I am weary I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest
From out of nowhere Felina has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss and Felina, good-bye"

With jacks and timbers they started back down
Then came that rumble way down in the ground
And then smoke and gas belched out of that mine
Everybody knew it was the end of the line for Big John

Now they never reopened that worthless pit
They just placed a marble stand in front of it

We'd start pickin' cotton, 
About daylight.
On Saturday, 
Pa'd take it all to town.

And he'd stop in the yard.
He'd sit up there on that wagon seat, 
And he'd say, Boys, I'm hard to beat, 
Two hundred pounds of steel, 
And twice as hard.
Southern, wild, and wooly and full of fleas, 
And there never been cares for all his needs, 
And he'd rear back and bellow out a course or two.

And about half wild, 
And I can whip anybody in about half mile, 
Of course there wasn't anybody there, 
Except me and little Skeet.
Just as tough as a hickory frier, 
And I can dive deeper and come up drier, 
And he did it too, 
Right off that wagon seat.
Oh, it shook him up, 
When he hit the ground.
Pa got up and looked around, 
And then ran back and let us have it again...

"mama sang a song","bill anderson","1962","Country","(Bill Anderson)
(God put a song in the heart of an angel)
(And softly she sang it to me.)
I get to thinking lots of times
About back when I was a lad
Of the old homeplace where I grew up
Of the days both good and bad.
My overalls were hand-me-downs
My shoes were full of holes
I used to walk four miles to school every day
Through the rain, the sleet and the cold.
I've seen the nights when my daddy would cry
For the things that his family would need
But all he ever got was a badland farm
And seven hungry mouths to feed.
And yet, and yet our homefire never flickered once
Cause when all these things went wrong
Mama took the hymn book down
And mama sang a song.
(What a friend we have in Jesus.)
I've been rocked to sleep many a night
To the tune of What a Friend
And come morning Rock of Ages
Would wake me gently once again.
And when daddy would reach up and he'd take the Bible down
And he'd read it, read it loud and long.
And I always felt that maybe our house was blessed
When daddy would say mama sing a song.
Sister left home first I guess and then Bob
And then Tommy and then Dan
By then dad's hair was turning white
And I had to be mama's little man.
But it seemed that as daddy's back grew weak
My mother's faith just grew strong
And those were the greatest days of all
When mama sang a song.
(Rock of ages cleft for me let me hide myself in Thee.)
I guess the house is still standing
I don't get to go back much anymore
No voice is left to fill those halls
And no steps to grace the floor.
For you see my mother sings in heaven now
Around God's golden throne
But I'll always believe that this world is a better place
Because one time my mama sang a song.
(Precious mem'ries flod my soul.)..."

In fact, I've lost just about everything since you went away
 (I love you still)
Everything that is except the memories you left me
And that's one things that no one can mar
I don't know who you're with, I don't even know where you've gone
My only hope is that some day you might hear this song
And you'll know, I wrote it especially for you
 (I love you still)
And I love you wherever you are
(Still)
After all this time
(Still)
You're still on my mind
(I love you still)
This flame in my heart is like an eternal fire
For every day it burns hotter and every day it burns higher
 (I love you still)
And I haven't been able to put out one little flicker
Not even with all of these tears
My friends all think, I'm crazy and maybe I am
But I'll carry this torch just as long as I can
For someday you might just decide to come home
 (I love you still)
And I want you to know, I'm still here
(Still)
Though you broke my heart
(Still)
Though you're far apart
(I love you still)"

Lonesome 7-7203 (1963)
Had our number changed today, although I hated to
But each time the phone would ring they'd want to speak to you
And it hurt's to tell them you’re not here with me
May be now oh telephone will let me be
It's not in the book now so you'd better write it down
Just in case your love for me should ever come around
You might want to call and break the news to me
Just call lonesome 7-7203
I keep the telephone beside me all the time
Hoping you might want to call and say you've changed your mind
If you do then darling you know where I'll be
I'm at lonesome 7-7203
You’re the only one I'm giving our new number too
So now if the telephone should ring I'll know it's you
If you ever long for love that used to be
Just call lonesome 7-7203

Prettiest town I ever seen.
Folks down there don't treat you mean
In Abilene, my Abilene.
I sit alone most every night
Watch them trains roll out of sight
Wish that they were carryin' me
To Abilene, my Abilene.
Crowded city, ain't nothin' free
Nothin' in this town for me
Wish to God that I could be
In Abilene, my Abilene.
How I wish that train would come
Take me back where I come from.
Take me where I want to be
In Abilene, my Abilene.
Rotgut whiskey numbs the brain
If I stay here I'll go insane.

Sit here starin' at the walls;

"bj the dj","stonewall jackson","1964","Country","A story 'bout a pal of mine
Who worked down near the Georgia Line
He's a D.J. in a little country station
Everybody loved him dear
'Cause he played what they liked to hear
He built himself a quite a reputation
At record hops he stayed out late
And his mom would always wait
To see if he had made it home alive
She warned against his loss of sleep
And driving fast in that old heap
And that he had to be at work by five
B.J. the D.J. you're living much too fast
And if you don't change your ways
Don't see how you can last
Every morning just past four
From the driveway he would roar
Overslept and he was late again
Then at breakneck speed he'd drive
To sign the station on at five
He had lots of records he must spin
His mom sits by the radio
Until his voice told her hello
She knew then that he made it there alright
Then she'd say a little prayer
Keep him safe for he was there
And she'd wait up for him again tonight
Then one cold and rainy morn
All four tires were badly worn
But still he screeched off just as fast this time
B.J. had a lot of nerve
But he completely missed the curve
And he signed off down near the Georgia Line
Mom sat by the radio
The voice she heard she didn't know
B.J.'d never been this late before
But with the road so bad and all
She'd wait a while before she called
And then she heard the knock upon the door
B.J. the D.J. only twenty-four
A wreck at ninety miles an hour
He'll spin the discs no more"

Miscellaneous
The Bridge Washed Out (1965)
The bridges washed out and I can’t swim and my baby’s on the other side
When I awoke this morning the rain was a pouring down
I was gonna wade a little river just over the bridge across town
Now I’m running up and down the river and my nerves are driving me wild
Cause the bridge washed out and I can’t swim and my baby’s on the other side
Rain, old rain, stop a falling dark clouds hurry from the sky
The preacher and my bride is a waiting and the wedding bells are starting to chime
I can’t kiss and hold her and it’s driving me put of my mind
Cause the bridge washed out and I can’t swim and my baby’s on the other side
Well I got one foot in the water and one foot solid on the ground
I’ll try to swim that raging old river but I know if I try I’ll drown
There’s not a boat around me they’ve all gone out with the tide
And the bridge washed out and I can’t swim and my baby’s on the other side
Rain, old rain, stop a falling dark clouds hurry from the sky
The preacher and my bride is a waiting and the wedding bells are starting to chime
I can’t kiss and hold her and it’s driving me put of my mind
Cause the bridge washed out and I can’t swim and my baby’s on the other side
Yes the bridge washed out and I can’t swim and my baby’s on the other side"

Don't tell me I'm losing the love that was mine
If you're really leaving, take some part of me
So I'll always remember how sweet love used to be
I wonder who's stepping into my shoes, who can he be?
I can tell by your eyes our love has died and it's over for me

Don't turn your head so close
Behind the teardrop
You'll see the hurt
You left inside a lonely man
Behind the tear there's a hurt
Behind the hurt a broken heart
Behind that broken heart
There lies a broken dream

Goodbye my sweetheart, Hello Vietnam.
America has heard the bugle call
And you know it involves us one and all

A hill to take a battle to be won
Kiss me goodbye and write me while I'm gone

A ship is waiting for us at the dock
America has trouble to be stopped
We must stop communism in that land
Or freedom will start slipping through our hands

That fires we don't put out will bigger burn
We must save freedom now at any cost
Or someday our own freedom will be lost

"may the bird of paradise fly up your nose","little jimmy dickens","1965","Country","One find day as I was walkin' down the street,
Spied a beggar man with rags upon his feet,
Took a penny from my pocket, in his tin cup I did drop it,
And I heard him say as I made my retreat:
""May the bird of paradise fly up your nose!
""May an elephant crush your mother's toes,
""May your wife be plagued with runners in her hose,
May the bird of paradise fly up your nose!""
My laundry man is really on his toes,
found a $100 bill among my clothes.
When he called me I came runnin', gave him back his dime for phonin'
And I heard him say as I turned to go:
""May the bird of paradise fly up your nose!
""May an elephant crush your mother's toes,
""May your wife be plagued with runners in her hose,
May the bird of paradise fly up your nose!""
I was way behind one day to catch a train,
the taxi driver said, ""We'll make it!"" just the same.
A speed cop made it with us, and as he wrote out the ticket,
I stood by politely waiting for my change.
""May the bird of paradise fly up your nose!
""May an elephant crush your mother's toes,
""May your wife be plagued with runners in her hose,

Met a girl with a drink in her hand
She had ruby red lips coal black hair and eyes
That would tempt any man
Then she came and sat down at my table
And as she placed her soft hands in mine
I found myself wanting to kiss her
For temptation was flowing like wine
And I was almost persuaded
To strip myself of my pride
Almost persuaded
To push my conscience aside
Then we danced and she whispered I need you
Take me away from here and be my man
Then I've looked into her eyes
And I saw it, the reflection of my wedding band
And I was almost persuaded
To let strange lips lead me on

The lips that have kissed her, that's loved her and missed her
Are lips that have cursed her at night
In anguish and torment, I've cursed as the night went
From darkness till dawn's golden light
I thought of just taking these two hands and breaking
The body I'm waiting to touch
I find while I'm waiting, there's no time for hating
While anticipating the woman I've wanted so much
I've placed pretty flowers to brighten the hours
I put brand new sheets on the bed
I'm nervous, I'm trembling, recalling remembering
The way that she tosses her head
I've given much thought to the fact that

We didn't find it there, so we moved on
And now we've left Alaska
Because there was no gold mine

Now you and I descended
On a world with innocent hopes
We traveled that criss-crossed highway
And cascaded down the slopes.
It's time to look at who we are
And let the feelings show
It's time to leave the past now
And grow.
I've listened to endless voices
I've proceeded with endless tact
I've figured in endless numbers
And I've worked on the traits I lacked.
I've come too far, the time is right
The devil's made his pact
It's time to stop pretending
And act.
I turn the world around
Change the things that need changing
Don't try to predict tomorrow

"i don't wanna play house","tammy wynette","1967","Country","(by Billy Sherrill/Glenn Sutton)
Today I sat alone at the window
And I watched our little girl outside at play
With the little boy next door like so many times before
But something didn't seem quite right today
So I went outside to see what they were doing
And then the teardrops made my eyes grow dim
'Cause I heard him name a game and I hung my head in shame
When I heard our little girl say to him.
I don't wanna play house; I know it can't be fun
I've watched mommy and daddy
And if that's the way it's done
I don't wanna play house; It makes my mommy cry
'Cause when she played house
My daddy said good-bye.
I don't wanna play house; I know it can't be fun
I've watched mommy and daddy
And if that's the way it's done
I don't wanna play house; It makes my mommy cry

'Cause you you mean all the world to me
You start my day with one sweet kiss
You keep my world turnin' with tenderness

"the legend of bonnie and clyde","merle haggard","1968","Country","Bonnie was a waitress in a small cafe
Clyde Barrow was the rounder that took her away
They both robbed and killed until both of them died
So goes the Legend of Bonnie and Clyde.
The poems that she wrote of the life that they led
Told of the lawmen left dying or dead
Some say that Clyde made her life a shame
But the legend made Bonnie the head of the game.
The rampage grew wilder with each passing day
The odds growing smaller with each get-a-way
With the end growing closer the harder they fought
With blood on their hands they were bound to get caught.
They drove back from town on one bright summer day
When a man they befriended stepped out in the way
With no thought of dyin' they pulled to the side
But death lay there waiting for Bonnie and Clyde.
Two years or runnin' was ended that day
For robbin' and killin' they both had to pay
But we'll always remember how they lived and died
So goes the legend of Bonnie and Clyde.

But friend, it hasn't been too long it wasn't big

The first day that she planted it was just a twig
Then the first snow came and she ran
Out to brush the snow away so it wouldn't die
Came runnin' in all excited
Slipped and almost hurt herself, I laughed 'til I cried
She was always young at heart
Kind a dumb and kind a smart and I loved her so
I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago
And it would sure embarrass her when
I came home from working late 'cause I would know
That she'd been sittin' there cryin'
Over some sad and silly late, late show
And honey, I miss you and I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you if only I could
She wrecked the car and she was sad
And so afraid that I'd be mad but what the heck
Though I pretended hard to be
Guess you could say, she saw through me and hugged my neck
I came home unexpectedly
And found her crying needlessly in middle of the day
And it was in the early spring
When flowers bloom and Robin's sing, she went away
And honey, I miss you and I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you if only I could
Yes, one day while I wasn't home
While she was there and all alone, the angels came
Now all I have is memories of honey
And I wake up nights and call her name
Now my life's an empty stage
Where honey lived and honey played and love grew up
A small cloud passes over head
And cries down in the flower bed that honey loved
See the tree, how big it's grown"

"hungry eyes","merle haggard","1969","Country","A canvas covered cabin in a crowded labour camp
Stand out in this memory I revived;
Cause my daddy raised a family there, with two hard working hands
And tried to feed my mama's hungry eyes.
He dreamed of something better, and my mama's faith was strong
And us kids were just to young to realize
That another class of people put us somewhere just below;
One more reason for my mama's hungry eyes.
Mama never had the luxuries she wanted
But it wasn't cause my daddy didn't try.
She only wanted things she really needed;
One more reason for my mama's hungry eyes.
I remember daddy praying for a better way of life
But I don't recall a change of any size;
Just a little loss of courage, as their age began to show
And more sadness in my mama's hungry eyes.
Mama never had the luxuries she wanted
But it wasn't cause my daddy didn't try.
She only wanted things she really needed;
One more reason for my mama's hungry eyes.
Oh, I still recall my mama's hungry eyes."

"a boy named sue","johnny cash","1969","Country","Well, my daddy left home when I was three
And he didn't leave much to ma and me
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze
Now, I don't blame him 'cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me Sue
Well, he must o' thought that is quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk
It seems I had to fight my whole life through
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue
Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame
But I made me a vow to the moon and stars
That I'd search the honky tonks and bars
And kill that man who gave me that awful name
Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid July
And I just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew
At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table, dealing stud
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me Sue
Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn out picture that my mother had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
He was big and bent and gray and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I said, ""My name is Sue! How do you do?
Now you're gonna die""
Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer
I tell ya, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him curse
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile
And he said, ""Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help you along
So I give you that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's the name that helped to make you strong""
He said, ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do
But you ought to thank me, before I die
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
'Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue
What could I do? Yeah what could I do?
I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
And I called him my pa, and he called me his son
And I came away with a different point of view
And I think about him, now and then
Every time I try and every time I win
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him
Bill or George anything but Sue I still hate that name"

TENNESSEE BIRD WALK
Jack Blanchard & Misty Morgan
Take away the trees and the birds
All have to sit upon the ground, uum
Take away their wings and
The birds will have to walk to get around
And take away the bird baths
And dirty birds will soon be ev'rywhere
Take away their feathers and
The birds will walk around in underwear
Take away their chirp and the
Birds will have to whisper when they sing
And take away their common sense and
They'll be headed southward in the spring
Oh remember my darling
When spring is in the air
And the bald headed birds
Are whisp'ring ev'rywhere
You can see them walking
Southward in their dirty underwear
That's Tennessee Bird walk
How about some trees so the birds
Won't have to sit upon the ground, uum
How about some wings so the
Birds won't have to walk to get around
And how about a bird bath or two
so the birds will all be clean
How about some feathers so their
Underwear no longer can be seen
How about a chirp so the birds
Won't have to whisper when they sing
And how about some common sense so they
Won't be blocking traffic in the spring
Oh remember my darling
When spring is in the air
And the bald headed birds
Are whisp'ring ev'rywhere
You can see them walking
Southward in their dirty underwear

"my woman my woman my wife","marty robbins","1970","Country","Hands that are strong but wrinkled
Doing work that never gets done
Hair, that's lost some of the beauty
By too many hours in the sun
Eyes, that show some disappointment
And there's been quite a lot in her life
She's the foundation I lean on
My woman, my woman, my wife
Everyday has been uphill
Oh, we climb but we can't reach the top
I'm weak and I'm easily discouraged
She just smiles when I want to stop
Lips, that are weary but tender
With love, that strengthens my life
A saint, in a dress made of gingham
My woman, my woman, my wife
Two little babies were born in the spring
But died when the winter was new
I lost control of my mind and my soul
But my woman's faith carried us through
When she reaches that river
Lord, you know what she's worth
Give her that mansion up yonder
'Cause she's been through hell here on earth
Lord, give her my share of Heaven
If I've earned any here in this life
'Cause God, I believe she deserves it

"the pool shark","dave dudley","1970","Country","He said, ""Pardon me for bein' so bold
But you got a cigarette that's already rolled""
I gave him one, he lit it in his own good time
The smoke in that poolroom hung like a fog
When he talked it sounded like a growling dog
He said, ""Would you care for a dollar on the five or nine?""
Now this man was ugly and his eyes were mean
His clothes were dirty but his hands were clean
He held that stick like a mother holds the hand of her child
Well, I've been known to hustle a few
When the waitress said, ""Was he playing you?""
And I said, ""Yeah, bring me brandy water by""
Little Red Parker was way in the back taking quarters and hadling racks
And I told him, ""Red, come up here, glue 'em up tight
That brandy had me feeling warm, I tipped that waitress
And I checked her form
And I said, ""Honey, you like a winner"", and she just smiled
I played like a man with a broken wrist, I won two and he won six
And I had him set up so I said, ""Let's play for five""
But this time the crowd had gathered round
To see this fish and just watch him drown
I told that waitress, ""More brandy water by""
Then he went out and got a custom cue
He said, ""It's no offense to you
But I don't play off the wall with nobody but friends""
He had a gold initials in a leather grip pearly and silver inlaid tip
He smiled at me and he said, ""Hell-a-way, we play for ten""
Well, I never seen a man that walk who made those balls and table talk
They're speaking English, he sure didn't need my help
He broke the ball and kept that string
For a hundred and eighty seven bucks and a ring
Till I gave up and said, ""Friend, you're gonna have to play by yourself""
Well, he racked it up and walked outside
And I strolled out just to watch him ride
And there was a blonde in their caddy built like the rest of that car
The boys in the poolroom they had 'em a laugh
And I hung it up and just let it pass
And had nothin' but my elbows to put on the bar
And the waitress smiled said, ""Water by?""
I took the charity and thanked her polite
And sittin' there sippin' and suddenly I had me a thought
Unlucky gambler and lucky in love
Guess you know what I was thinking of
When I said waitress, ""Honey, what time you get off?"""

With no way to hold my head, that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
So I had one more for dessert
Then I fumbled in my closet
Through my clothes and found my cleanest, dirty shirts
Then I washed my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day
I'd smoked my mind the night before
With cigarettes and the songs I'd been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Playin' with a can that he was kicking
Then I walked across the street
And caught the Sunday smell of someone's fryin' chicken
And, Lord, it took me back to somethin'
That I'd lost somewhere, somehow along the way
On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned
'Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothin' short of dyin'
That's half as lonesome as the sound
Of the sleepin' city sidewalk

In the park, I saw a daddy
With a laughin' little girl that he was swingin'
And I stopped beside a Sunday school
And listened to the songs they were singin'
Then I headed down the streets
And somewhere far away, a lonely bell was ringin'
And it echoed through the canyons
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday

And thereâs nothing cold as ashes, after the fire is gone

We know itâs wrong for us to meet but the fires gone out at home
And thereâs nothing cold as ashes, after the fire is gone

And thereâs nothing cold as ashes, after the fire is gone
Your lips are warm and tender; your arms hold me just right
Sweet words of love you remember that the one at home forgot
Each time we say itâs the last time, but we keep hanging on
And thereâs nothing cold as ashes, after the fire is gone

Even though I love my wife.
It's because I really love her,

But I know she knows
I can see it in her eyes.
I try to stay at home, love only her,
Play with the kids and watch T.V.
But then my mind becomes unsure
About the kind of love I need.
My reasons for cheating
There as good as lies can be
How much more can she stand
And still stand by me?

It's so hard for me to call her
I can hardly dial the phone

Now I just want to go back home.

"the year that clayton delaney died","tom t hall","1971","Country","I remember the year
That clayton delaney died
They said for the last two weeks
That he suffered and cried
It made a big impression on me
Although i was a barefoot kid
They said he got religion at the end
And i'm glad that he did
Clayton was the best guitar picker
In our town
I thought he was a hero
And i used to follow clayton around
I often wondered why clayton
Who seemed so good to me
Never took his guitar
And made it down in tenn-o-see
Well daddy said he drank a lot
But i could never understand
I knew he used to pick up in ohio
With a five piece band
Clayton used to tell me son
You'd better put that ol' guitar away
There ain't no money in it
It will lead you to an early grave
I guess if i'd admit it
Clayton taught me how to drink booze
I can see him half stoned
A-pickin' out the lovesick blues
When clayton died i made him a promise
I was going to carry on some how
I'd give a hundred dollars
If he could only see me now
I remember the year
That clayton delaney died
Nobody ever knew it
But i went out in the woods and i cried
While i know there's a lot of big preachers
That know a lot more than i do
It could be that the good lord
Likes a little pickin' too
Yeah i remember the year
That clayton delaney died"

And the singing of the birds woke us up at the break of day
Her smiling eyes always seemed to try to understand
All the love in my heart for the girl made in Japan
My transistor radio comes from far away
And when it's night over here, over there it's a breaking day
She cried when she said she'd been promised to another man
That's when I left my heart with the girl made in Japan
Yes, my heart will always be with the girl made in Japan"

"soul song","joe stampley","1973","Country","Well i can believe because i have seen it
A moment near took my soul
I've relived a thousand times over
Each time i recall more
Sliding and gliding hydroplane was the game
Life line held clenched in fist
Panic and worry for all that we've spoken
Shared feelings that we know exist
I can say that i have lived
Because strength of will is destiny
And it lies deep inside
And never lets you die
Yellow line nightmare we crossed over
The time and place no control
The wide open eyes and fixed blank stares
I thought we were gonna die
Sailing on cold air knee deep in snow
Don't fight momentum let go
Safe on the far side escaped from the fear
The fear of dying that day
I can say that i have lived
Because strength of will is destiny
And it lies deep inside
And never lets you die
I'm living to tell you about it
I'm living to tell you about it

The truth i speak shall prevail

When this old gray Black gentleman was cleanin' up the lounge
There wasn't anyone around 'cept this old man and me
The guy who ran the bar was watchin' ""Ironsides"" on TV
Uninvited, he sat down and opened up his mind
On old dogs and children and watermelon wine
""Ever had a drink of watermelon wine?"", he asked
He told me all about it, though I didn't answer back
""Ain't but three things in this world that's worth a solitary dime
But old dogs and children and watermelon wine""
He said, ""Women think about they-selves, when menfolk ain't around
And friends are hard to find when they discover that you're down""
He said, ""I tried it all when I was young and in my natural prime
Now it's old dogs and children and watermelon wine""
""Old dogs care about you even when you make mistakes
God bless little children while they're still too young to hate""
When he moved away I found my pen and copied down that line
'Bout old dogs and children and watermelon wine

As I left for my room I saw him pickin' up my change
That night I dreamed in peaceful sleep of shady summertime

She'll pull off the highway and she'll cry.
And she needs someone to hold her when she cries
Someone who really understands the way she feels inside
When her heart breaks the tears won't stop, no matter how she tries
And she needs someone to hold her when she cries.
I don't blame her for leavin' Lord, she didn't want to go
But she thinks I don't love her or need her anymore
I've driven her into a world as dark and cold as ice
With no one there to hold her when she cries.

Someone who really understands the way she feels inside
And if she ever loves again I hope that she will find
Someone who'll always hold her when she cries."

She's never too far away or too tired to say ""I want you""
She's always a lady, just like a lady should be
But when they turn out the lights, she's still a baby to me
And when we get behind closed doors
Then she lets her hair hang down
And she makes me glad that I'm a man
Oh, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors
Behind closed doors"

Thirty some odd years ago
A young man came to Memphis
Askin' 'bout a rose that used to blossom
In his world
People never took the time
To mind the young man's questions
Until one day they heard him ask
A little green eyed girl
What's your mama's name child?
What's your mama's name?
Does she ever talk about
A place called New Orleans?
Has she ever mentioned
A man named Bueferd Wilson?
What's your mama's name child?
What's your mama's name?
Twenty some odd years ago
A drunk went down in Memphis
Lost a month of life and labor
To the county jail
Just because he asked
A little green eyed girl a question
And offered her a nickel's
Worth of candy if she'd tell
A year and some odd days ago
An old man died in Memphis
Just another wayward
So the county had to claim
Inside the old mans ragged coat
They found a faded letter
It said 'You have a daughter
And her eyes are Wilson green'

When you tucked me into bed to say my prayers
And I'll bet I never thanked you among all the other things
That I took for granted cause you were always there.

'Cause before I got to know you died of loneliness
And they tell me I grew up and moved away.

Four wheeled buggies from Detroit City, then pay attention
I'm about to sing your song son
Well, I'm not a man appointed judge
To bear ill-will and hold a grudge
But I think it's time I said me a few choice words
All about that demon automobile
A metal box with the polyglass wheel
The end result to the dream of Henry Ford
Well, I've got a car that's mine alone
That me and the finance company own
A ready made pile of manufactured grief
And if I ain't out of gas in the pouring rain
I'm a-changing a flat in a hurricane
I once spent three days lost on a cloverleaf
Well, it ain't just the smoke and the traffic jam
That makes me the bitter fool I am

For gas and oils and fluids and grease
And wires and tires and anti-freeze
And them accessories, well honey that's something else
Well, you can get a stereo tape and a color TV
Get a backseat bar and reclining seats
And just pay once a month, like you do your rent
Well, I figured it up and over a period of time
This four thousand dollar car of mine
Costs fourteen thousand dollars and ninety-nine cents

What your simple horseless carriage has become
Well, it seems your contribution to man
To say the least, got a little out of hand
Well, Lord Mr. Ford, what have you done
Now the average American father and mother
Own one whole car and half another
And I bet that half a car is a trick to buy, don't you?
But the thing that amazes me I guess
Is the way we measure a man's success
By the kind of an automobile he can afford to buy
Well now, red light, green light, traffic cop
Right turn, no turn, must turn, stop
Get out the credit card honey, we're out of gas
Well, now all the car's placed end to end
Would reach to the moon and back again
And there'd probably be some fool pull out to pass
Well now, how I yearn for the good old days
Without that carbon monoxide haze
A-hanging over the roar of the interstate
Well, if the Lord that made the moon and stars
Would have meant for me and you to have cars
He'd have seen that we was all born with a parking space
Lord Mr. Ford, I just wish that you could see
What your simple horseless carriage has become

Then I'll be there with you and all of our dreams will come true.
And we'll both live in a world of make believe.
And we'll both live in a world of make believe..."

"country bumpkin","cal smith","1974","Country","He walked into the bar and parked
His lanky frame upon a tall barstool
With a long soft Southern drawl said
""I'll just have a glass of anything that's cool""
A barroom girl with hard and knowing eyes
Slowly looked him up and down
And she thought, ""I wonder how on earth
That country bumpkin found his way to town""
She said ""Hello, country bumpkin
How's the frost out on the pumpkin?
I've seen some sights but, man, you're somethin'
Where'd ya come from, country bumpkin?""
It was just a short year later in a bed
Of joy-filled tears yet death-like pain
Into this wondrous world of many wonders
One more wonder came
That same woman's face was wrapped up
In a raptured look of love and tenderness
As she marveled at the soft and warm
And cuddly boy-child feeding at her breast
And she said, ""Hello, country bumpkin
Fresh as frost out on the pumpkin
I've seen some sights but, babe, you're somethin'
And mama loves her country bumpkin""
Forty years of hard work later
In a simple quiet and peaceful country place
The heavy hand of time had not erased
The raptured wonder from the woman's face
She was lying on her deathbed
Knowing fully well her race was nearly run
But she softly smiled and looked into the sad eyes
Of her husband and her son
And she said, ""So long, country bumpkin
The frost is gone now from on the pumpkin
I've seen some sights and life's been somethin'
See you later, country bumpkin""
She said ""So long, country bumpkin'
The frost is gone now from on the pumpkin

Growin' inside me, no charge
For the nights I've sat up with you
Doctored you, prayed for you, no charge
For the time and the tears
And the cost through the years, there's no charge

For the nights filled with dread
And the worries ahead, no charge
For advice and the knowledge

"back home again","john denver","1974","Country","There's a storm across the valley, clouds are rollin' in
The afternoon is heavy on your shoulders
There's a truck out on the four lane, a mile or more away
The whinin' of his wheels just makes it colder
He's an hour away from ridin' on your prayers up in the sky
And ten days on the road are barely gone
There's a fire softly burning, supper's on the stove
It's the light in your eyes that makes him warm
Hey, it's good to be back home again
Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend
Yes, an', hey, it's good to be back home again
There's all the news to tell him, how do you spend your time?
What's the latest thing the neighbors say
And your mother called last Friday, sunshine made her cry
You felt the baby move just yesterday
Hey, it's good to be back home again, yes, it is
Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend
Yes, an', hey, it's good to be back home again
Oh the time that I can lay this tired old body down
Feel your fingers feather soft upon me
The kisses that I live for, the love that lights my way
The happiness that livin' with you brings me
It's the sweetest thing I know of, just spending time with you
It's the little things that make a house a home
Like a fire softly burning the supper on the stove
The light in your eyes, it makes me warm
Hey, it's good to be back home again
Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend
Yes, an', hey, it's good to be back home again

"kentucky gambler","merle haggard","1975","Country","I wanted more from life, than four kids and a wife
And a job in a dark Kentucky mine.
A twenty acre farm, with a shackey house and barn
Thats all I had and all I left behind
But at gambling, I was lucky, and so I left Kentucky
And left behind my woman and my kids
Into the gay casinos, of Nevada's town of Reno
This Kentucky Gambler planned to get rich quick
Kentucky gambler who's going to love your woman in Kentucky
Yeah - and who's going to be the one to give her all she needs
Kentucky gambler, who's going to raise your children in Kentucky
And who's going to keep them fed and keep them shoes on their feet
There at the gambler's Paradise, Lady luck was on my side
and this Kentucky gambler played just right
Yeah I won at everything I played - I really thought I had it made
But I should have quit and gone on home that night
But when you love the green backed dollar, sorrow always bound to follow
and Reno's dreams fade into neon amber
And Lady Luck, she'll lead you on
She'll stay a while, and then she's gone
You better go on home, Kentucky gambler
But a gambler never seems to stop, till he loses all he's got
and with a money - hungry fever, I played on
I played till I'd lost all I'd won, I was right back where I'd started from
Then I started wanting - to go home
Kentucky gambler, there ain't nobody, waiting in Kentucky
When I ran out, somebody else walked in
Kentucky gambler, looks like you ain't really very lucky
And it seems to me a gambler loses much more than he wins
much more than he wins."

Miscellaneous
City Lights
A bright array of city lights
As far as I can see.
The great white way
Shines through the night
For lonely guys like me.
The cabarets and honky tonks
Their flashing signs invite.
The broken heart can lose itself
In the glow of city lights.
Lights that say forget him now
In a glass of sherry wine.
Lights that offer other girls
For empty hearts like mine.
They paint a pretty picture
Of a world that's gay and bright,
And it's just a mask for loneliness
Behind those city lights.
          (turn around)
The world was dark
God made the stars
To brighten up the night
But the God who put those stars above
I don't believe He made those lights.
It's just a place for me to cry
When things don't turn out right.
Just a place to run away and hide
Behind those city lights.
Lights that say forget her love
In a different atmosphere
Lights that lure are nothing
But a masquerade for tears.
They paint a pretty picture
But my arms can't hold 'em tight,
And I just can't say that I love you
To a street of city lights.
No, I just can't say that I love you
To a street of city lights."

And it's sad to know we've danced it all away

Leaving nothing but the cold hard light of day
And it's time to start erasing

We know there's no way of making
Other ties on us unravel and unwind
Yes it's time to pay the fiddler
And today's the day the first installment's due
For the rest of all my days I'll wonder why
The maker mismatched me and you
But there's so much to consider like my wife and little children
Will need and want my love just like you do
Now it's time to pay the fiddler but before we pay the fiddler
Let's ask him to please play one last final tune
Well it's time to pay the fiddler
And there's naked sorrow dripping from your eyes
Unrestrained and unashamed we love each other

As I search to find the handle on the door
So let's let the fiddler pull his magic bow
Across our heart strings just once more"

Would play that ol' Opry show

And dream that I was right there
Just singing the whole night through
When my folks would come home
They'd be humming a song
Mamma'd smile and say, ""Child don't you know
There ain't a thing in this world
To make you fall in love girl

When my momma said, ""Hon'
It's 'bout time you came with us as well""
Well, I had me a time
Yes, I danced all night
Till they rang that old cracked midnight bell
Then the lights went down low
The fiddler picked up his bow
And he played something stately and slow
And my sister Eileen and her husband to be
They held hands and began to stroll

Painting walls and sipping wine, sleeping on the floor

I was proud and satisfied, life had so much to give
Till the day they told me that she didn't have long to live
She said Rocky I never had to die before don't know if I can do it
Now it's back to two again my little girl and I
Who looks so much like her sweet mother, sometimes that makes me cry
I sleep alone at nights again, I walk alone each day
And sometimes when I'm about to give in, I hear her sweet voice say to me

But if you'd like to lean on me, take my hand I'll help you through it, through it.

"the roots of my raising","merle haggard","1976","Country","I left a four lane highway took a black top seven miles down by the
old country school I went to as a child. Three miles down the gravel
road I could see a proud old home. A tribute to a way of life that's
almost come and gone.
The roots of my raising run deep. I've come back for the strength
that I need. And hope comes no matter how far down I sink.
The roots of my raising run deep.
I pulled up in the driveway, and boy is sure was good to be there
and through the open door I could see that dad was asleep in his
favorite chair. In his hand was a picture of mom and I remember
how close they were, so I just turned away. I didn't want to wake
him, spoil his dreams of her.
A christian mom who had the strength for life the way she did.
Then to pull that apron off and do the Charleston for us kids.
Dad, a quiet man, whose gentle voice was seldom heard,
who could borrow money at the back simply on his word.
The roots of my raising run deep. I've come back for the strength
that I need. And hope comes no matter how far down I sink.
The roots of my raising run deep.
The roots of my raising run deep."
"faster horses the cowboy and the poet","tom t hall","1976","Country","He was an old time cowboy
Don't you understand
His eyes were sharp as razor blades
His face was leather tanned
His toes were pointed inward
From a hangin' on a horse
He was an old
Philosopher of course
He was so thin I swear
You could have used him for a whip
He had to drink a beer
To keep his breeches on his hips
I knew I had to ask him
About the mysteries of life
He spat between his boots
And he replied
""It's faster horses
Younger women
Older whiskey
More money""
He smiled and all his teeth
Were covered with tobacco stains
He said, ""It don't do men no good
To pray for peace and rain""
""Peace and rain is just
A way to say prosperity
And buffalo chips is all
That means to me""
I told him I was a poet
I was lookin' for the truth
I do not care for horses
Whiskey women or the loot
I said I was a writer
My soul was all on fire
He looked at me
And he said you are a liar
""Son, it's faster horses
Younger women
Older whiskey
More money""
Well, I was disillusioned
If I say the least
I grabbed him by the collar
And I jerked him to his feet
There was somethin' cold
And shiny laying by my head
So I started to believe
The things he said
Well, my poet days're over
And I'm back to bein' me
As I enjoy the peace a
And comfort of reality
If my boy ever asks me
What it is that I have learned
I think that
I will readily affirm
""Son, it's faster horses
Younger women
Older whiskey
More money""
Faster horses
Younger women
Older whiskey
More money
Faster horses

"one piece at a time","johnny cash","1976","Country","Well, I left Kentucky back in '49
And went to Detroit workin' on a assembly line
The first year they had me puttin' wheels on Cadillacs
Every day I'd watch them beauties roll by
And sometimes I'd hang my head and cry
'Cause I always wanted me one that was long and black
One day I devised myself a plan
That should be the envy of 'most any man
I'd sneak it out of there in a lunchbox in my hand
Now gettin' caught meant gettin' fired
But I figured I'd have it all by the time I retired
I'd have me a car worth at least a hundred grand
I'd get it one piece at a time and it wouldn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style, I'm gonna drive everybody wild
'Cause I'll have the only one there is around
So the very next day when I punched in
With my big lunchbox and with help from my friends
I left that day with a lunch box full of gears
I never considered myself a thief
But GM wouldn't miss just one little piece
Especially if I strung it out over several years
The first day I got me a fuel pump
And the next day I got me an engine and a trunk
Then I got me a transmission and all the chrome
The little things I could get in my big lunchbox
Like nuts and bolts and all four shocks
But the big stuff we snuck out in my buddy's mobile home
Now, up to now my plan went all right
'Til we tried to put it all together one night
And that's when we noticed that something was definitely wrong
The transmission was a '53 and the motor turned out to be a '73
And when we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone
So we drilled it out so that it would fit
And with a little bit of help with an adaptor kit
We had that engine runnin' just like a song
Now the headlight that was another sight
We had two on the left and one on the right
But when we pulled out the switch all three of 'em come on
The back end looked kinda funny too
But we put it together and when we got through
Well, that's when we noticed that we only had one tail-fin
About that time my wife walked out
And I could see in her eyes that she had her doubts
But she opened the door and said, ""Honey, take me for a spin""
So we drove up town just to get the tags
And I headed her right on down main drag
I could hear everybody laughin' for blocks around
But up there at the court house they didn't laugh
'Cause to type it up it took the whole staff
And when they got through the title weighed sixty pounds
I'd got it one piece at a time and it wouldn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style, I'm gonna drive everybody wild
'Cause I'll have the only one there is a round
Ah yeah Red Ryder this is the cottonmouth
In the pshycho Billy, Cadillac, come on
Ah, this is the cottonmouth a negatory
On the cost of this mow-chine there Red Ryder
You might say I went right up to the factory
And picked it up, it's cheaper that way
Ah! What model is it?

"el paso city","marty robbins","1976","Country","From thirty thousand feet above
The desert floor, I see it there below
A city with a legend
The west Texas city of El Paso
Where long ago, I heard a song
About a Texas cowboy and a girl
And a little place called Rosa's
Where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl
I don't recall who sang the song
But I recall the story that I heard
And as I look down on the city
I remember each and every word
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy
And the way he used a gun
To kill another cowboy
Then he had to leave El Paso on the run
El Paso City by the Rio Grande
The cowboy lived and rode away
But love was strong, he couldn't stay
He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand
El Paso City by the Rio Grande
I try not to let you cross my mind
But still I find there's such a mystery
In the song that I don't understand
My mind is down there somewhere
As I fly above the badlands of New Mexico
I can't explain why I should know
The very trail he rode back to El Paso
Can it be that man can disappear
From life and live another time
And does the mystery deepen 'cause you think
That you yourself lived in that other time
Somewhere in my deepest thoughts
Familiar scenes and memories unfold
These wild and unexplained emotions
That I've had so long but I have never told
Like every time I fly up through the heavens
And I see you there below
I get the feeling sometime
In another world I lived in El Paso
El Paso City by the Rio Grande
Could it be that I could be
The cowboy in this mystery
That died there in that desert sand so long ago
El Paso City by the Rio Grande
A voice tells me to go and see
Another voice keeps tellin' me
Maybe death awaits me in El Paso

When there came a little boy's voice on the radio line
And he said, ""Breaker 1-9, is anyone there?
Come on back, truckers and talk to Teddy Bear""
Well, I keyed the mike and said, ""You got it, Teddy Bear""
And a little boy's voice came back on the air
Appreciate the Breaker who we got on that end
I told him my handle and then he began
Though I'm not supposed to bother you fellows out there
Mom says, you're busy and for me to stay off the air
But you see I get lonely and it helps to talk
'Cause that's about all I can do, I'm crippled and I can't walk
I came back and told him to fire up that mike
And I'd talk to him as long as he'd liked
""This was my dad's radio"", the little boy said
But I guess it's mine and mom's now, 'cause my daddy's dead
Dad had a wreck about a month ago
He was tryin' to get home in a blindin' snow
Mom has to work now to make ends meet
And I'm not much help with my two crippled feet
She says not to worry that we'll make it alright
But I hear her cryin' sometimes late at night
You know there's one thing, I want more than anything else to see
Oh I know you guys are too busy to bother with me
But you see my dad used to take me for rides when he was home
But I guess that's all over now since my daddy's gone
Not one breaker came on the old CB
As that little crippled boy talked with me
I tried hard to swallow a lump just wouldn't stay down
As I thought about my boy back in Greenville Town
Dad was gonna take mom and me with him later on this year
Why I remember him sayin' someday
This old truck will be yours Teddy Bear
But I know now, I'll never get a ride on 18-wheeler again
But this old base'll keep me in touch with all my trucker friends
Teddy Bear's gonna back on out now and leave you alone
'Cause it's about time for mom to come home
But you give me shout when you're passin' through
And I'll surely be happy to come back to you
Well, I came back and I said, ""Before you go 10-10
What's your home 20 little CB friend?""
Well, he gave me his address and I didn't once hesitate
'Cause this hot load of freight would just have to wait
I turened that truck around on a dime
And headed straight for Jackson Street 229
And as I rounded the corner, oh, I got one the heck of a shock
18-wheeler were lined up for three city blocks
I guess every driver for miles around had caught Teddy Bear's call
And that little crippled boy was havin' a ball
For as fast as one driver would carry him in
Another would carry him to his truck and take off again
Well, you better believe I took my turn rifin' Teddy Bear
And then carried him back in and put him down in his chair
And buddy if I never live to see happiness again
I want you to know, I saw it that day in the face of that little man
We took up a collection for him before his mama got home
And each driver said goodbye and then they were all gone
He shook my hand with a mile long grin
And said, ""So long trucker I'll catch you again""
Well, I hit that Interstate with tears in my eyes
I turned on the radio and I got another surprise
Breaker 1-9, came the voice on the air
Just one word of thanks from mama Teddy Bear
We wish each and everyone a special prayer for you
'Cause you just made my little boy's dream come true
I'll sign off now before I start to cry
May God ride with you 10-4 and goodbye"

A couple gazes at the wedding rings

She smiles and nods her head
As he says, ""Honey, that's for you

That I can do""
Golden rings with one tiny little stone
Waiting there for someone to take it home
By itself it's just a cold metallic thing
Only love can make a golden wedding ring
In a little wedding chapel later on that afternoon
An old upright piano plays that old familiar tune
Tears roll down her cheeks
And happy thoughts run through her head
As he whispers low, ""With this ring, I thee wed""
Golden ring with one tiny little stone
Shining ring, now at last it's found a home

Only love can make a golden wedding ring
In a small two room apartment
As they fought their final round
He says, ""You won't admit it
But I know you're leavin' town""
She says, ""One thing's for certain
I don't love you any more""
And throws down the ring
As she walks out the door
Golden ring with one tiny little stone
Cast aside like the love that's dead and gone
By itself it's just a cold metallic thing
Only love can make a golden wedding ring

with a voice that sounded older
He said, ""Mom, I got something on my mind.
I don't wanna bother you but
I sure need to talk to you
If you can only spare the time.
And Mom I hope you understand
How much I love and need you
And I don't want you to take this the wrong way
But don't you think I'm old enough
And big enough and strong enough
To play the games that Daddies play?""
My friend Billy Parker's dad
Came by today to see me
And he wondered if I'd like to go
With him and Billy on a hike
And maybe camp out overnight
The way I've seen 'em do in picture shows
And there's one thing I'd like to do
And maybe if I ask him to
He'd sit and talk with me man to man
We'd only be gone overnight
And I could find out what it's like
To play the games that Daddies play.
She quickly turned to hide the tears
From her son of seven years
He didn't know she'd read between the lines
He'd never really known his dad
And although he'd never ask
She knew exactly what was on his mind
She searched her mind in desperation,
Six long years of separation
Dimmed the words she knew she had to say
I hope you're never big enough
Or old enough or bold enough
To play the games that Daddies play.
I know you need and want his love but,
Son, you're the victim of
Another kind of game that Daddies play..."

On a barstool she took off her ring
I thought I'd get closer

I sat down and asked her name
When the drink finally hit her

But I finally quit living on dreams
I'm hungry for laughter
And here ever after
I'm after whatever
The other life brings

And I closely watch him
I thought how he looked out of place
He came to the woman
Who sat their beside me
He had a strange look on his face
The big hands were calloused
He looked like a mountain
For a minute I thought I was dead
But he started shakin'
His big heart was breakin'
He turned to the woman and said
""You picked the fine time to leave me Lucille
Four hungry children and a crop in the field
I've had some bad times
Lived thru' some sad times
But this time your hurtin' won't heal
You picked the fine time to leave me Lucille""
After he left us, I ordered more whiskey
I thought how she made him look small
From the lights of the bar room to a rented hotel room
We walked without talking at all
She was a beauty, but when she came to me
She must have thought I lost my mind
I couldn't hold her, 'coz the words that he told her
Kept coming back time after time

So lay a little closer
By my side
Let me take my weakness
And love it out on you
Right now, I need your love
To hold on to
She's pulling me back again
Darling, don't let her win
Take me in your arms, right now
Hold me tight
She's standing outside again
Wanting to come back in
So if you've ever loved
Love me tonight
She's pulling me back again"
"play guitar play","conway twitty","1977","Country","Play, guitar play
Take me back to yesterday
Let me see, cotton growing
In the fields
Let me hear, my momma calling
Look yonder y'all who's coming
Down the road, he's a coming home
But they know I never will
I left them living with that awful thing I done
I didn't tell them I just packed my clothes and run
Play, guitar play
Help me through another day
Help me make another dollar
Before I go
We got time, for one more song
Then we'll have to move along
Another town, another crowd
Lord, I wonder if they know
Can they read between the lines in my song
As I sing about a good boy that's went wrong
Guitar we got years to kill
We got to climb that distant hill
I wonder if they think of me
Guitar play"

First thing every morning

Rendezvous in the night
you're willing warmer
to hold me tight.
But in the middle of loveshinbrace
I see your face.

"that was yesterday","donna fargo","1977","Country","You know, I've always believed
That when you feel somethin'
Especially somethin' good for someone
You shouldn't keep it from them
You should let him know
But I also believe that
If you think it's love
There's really no need to bring it up
If you know there's no chance for it to grow
But it seems like
I'm always coming up with contradictions
Because now I find that
What I believe and what I feel
Are two very different things
And those feelings I've kept all to myself
Are gonna come out now
Even though they've changed
So you see
I guess I was right in one way
That I never told you this
And I don't really know why I'm telling you now
But I'd just kinda like you to know that
There couldn't be a you and me
I might've changed my life for you
And you might've changed for me
If there weren't so many ifs and buts
And if you had wanted it to be
But because of the way I am
And the way you are
We never took the chance, did we?
Call it respect, because we're not free
Call it fear of rejection because of our pride
Or call it just plain old common sense
That it would be just too risky
And too sticky a situation
Because we wouldn't know exactly where we were going
And we'd be afraid to take the ride
Call it whatever, but I wanted you to know that
I like you very much
And you're the kind of person I could love
You're honest, sincere, compassionate, not afraid
To be too gentle and not afraid to be too strong and
You got that certain kind of something
People are always looking for and rarely find and
Never seem to get enough of and somehow
It doesnt seem wrong to tell you that
No, we never kissed and never touched each other
But our hearts have and our souls have and
If we gaved them half the chance
Look out, for I'll bet they could start a fire
That nobody in the whole world could put out
But that was yesterday, wasn't it?
And things are so different now
See I was right not to ever tell you
Because I guess I always knew
It would of never really had a chance to grow
And though I'll use my better judgement again
And never mail this letter
I still kinda wanted you to know"

What you're looking for
'Cause you're as tempting a woman
As I've ever seen
But there's someone in Dallas
Who's trusting in me
She's the mother of my children
I'm the rock she leans on
So thank you but no thank you
I'll be leaving alone
As we dance in the shadows
And you're holding me tight
I can feel the invitation
I've seen in your eyes
And the soft light and the music
And the wine's rosy glow
Ain't making it easy
For me to say no

As I've ever seen
But there's someone in Dallas
Who's trusting in me

So I think I'm gonna tell something I think you should know
Now you don't recognize what's right before your eyes
The best you've ever had you're gonna blow
You have a girl that loves you she could never be untrue
Well buddy let me say that's more than I can say for you
If giving her some happiness is messing up your plans
I'll be more than happy to take her off your hands
I mean that she can put her shoes under my bed anytime
Anytime she's ready mmm it'll be okay
She can have the key to my door anytime
And she can move right into my life and stay
Now you don't have to listen just keep doing what you do
She's only one more hurt away boy from walking out on you
But if you want to keep her one thing you better know
Once she gets to walking she won't have far to go
You know that she can put her shoes under my bed anytime
Anytime that woman's ready mmm it'll be okay
She can have the key to my door anytime
And she can move right into my house and stay

"do you know you are my sunshine","the statler brothers","1978","Country","She was standin' in the crowd
All alone and lookin' pretty
Listening to the music that we played
She walked up and whispered
I leaned down and listened
To the request that she made
""Do you know you are my sunshine?”
She asked so sweet and tenderly
""Do you know you are my sunshine?
And would you do it one more time for me""
Border to border
And ocean to ocean
I still look for her every place
Chasin' the sunshine
Each and every night I'm
Searchin' every crowd for her face
She was gone just as quick
As the song that she asked for
Takin' my sunshine away
But someday when I finally
Look down and see her
I know, just what I'm going to say
Do you know you are my sunshine?
Do you know what your smile did to me?
Do you know you are my sunshine?
And it looks like you're always going to be
Do you know you are my sunshine?
Do you know what your smile did to me?
Do you know you are my sunshine?
And would you do it one more time for me
Do you know you are my sunshine?"

"i'll be true to you","the oak ridge boys","1978","Country","They met upon a blue moon,
And they parted on a cloudy day
They were so in love and out of school,
But he was goin' so far, far away.
She said: ""I'll be true to you,
""Even though you don't want me to.
""And I'll be blue for you,
""Even though you've asked me not to.""
Well the year's drifted by them, as we all know they can.
He found other women, but she refused other men.
But as fate would have it, they met again,
She was on a down-hill slide, and he was just slidin' in.
As he looked into her eyes that night, he didn't realize.
The only real love in his life was passin' by.
When he turned and left her there, his words: ""Goodbye"".
He heard her calling out to him, and as he walked, she cried:
""I've been true to you.
""Seems like speakin' to me is the least that you could do.
""And I've been blue for you,
""Even though you've asked me not to.""
She'd been drinkin way too hard one night,
She'd been drinkin way too long.
Alone and pale in a cheap hotel, she died there in the dawn.
Kneelin' by the grave, oh so late and oh so wrong,
He longed to hold her close again, cryin' on and on.
He cried: ""Ill be true to you.
""After all that I have put you through.
""And I'll be blue for you,
""Though you never even asked me to."""

The chances your taking loving a free living man
Are you really sure you really want what you see

I met up with the gambler, we were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a starin' out the window at the darkness
'Til boredom overtook us and he began to speak
He said, ""Son, I've made a life, out of readin' people's faces
And knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes
So if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice""
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression
Said, ""If you're gonna play the game, boy, you gotta learn to play it right""
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run

There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done
Every gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep
'Cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep
And when he finished speakin', he turned back towards the window
Crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run

"every which way but loose","eddie rabbitt","1979","Country","I've always been the kind of man
Who doesn't believe in strings
Long term obligations are just unnecessary things
But girl, ya got me thinkin
While I'm drinkin one more beer
If I'm headed for a heartache
Then why the hell am I still here
I'm testin my resistance
And it's wearin mighty thin
I've got the feelin I should leave
Before the roof caves in
My mind tells me to move along
But my body begs me stay
And now I feel the need to hold you close
And love the night away
While you're turnin me
Chorus: Every which way but loose
You turn me
Every which way but loose
Inside the fire's burnin me
In my mind you just keep turnin me
Every which but loose
Baby there's no excuse
To turn me every which way but loose
When the sun comes up in the mornin
It should find me some place new
But right this minute all I want
Is to lay here next to you
Those memories still keep callin me
From somewhere in my past
Better hurry if they want me
'Cause I can feel me fadin fast
While you're turnin me

From paper shades to curtains
From neon lights to crystal chandeliers
From cut glass to diamonds

Well, I traded in my Levi's
For high heels and flowing gowns
And the parties, and the swimming pools
And the scenic view of town
Now, she once told me, she didn't need love
And that money would see her through the years
That's the last time, that I saw him
In my eyes full of golden tears
From a Chevy to a Lincoln
From paper shades to curtains
From neon lights to crystal chandeliers
From cut glass to diamonds
Up that ladder she's climbing crying golden tears
Well, now her picture is in the papers
At country clubs with lots and lots of good times
But my smile is artificial
Because the story is between the line

From paper shades to curtains
From neon lights to crystal chandeliers

"she believes in me","kenny rogers","1979","Country","While she lays sleeping
I stay out late at night and play my songs
And sometimes, all the nights can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home
All alone
While she lays dreaming
I try to get undressed without the light
And quietly she says, ""How was your night?""
And I come to her and say, ""It was all right""
And I hold her tight
And she believes in me
I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday, if she was my girl
I could change the world with my little songs
I was wrong
But she has faith in me
And so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe, on some special night
If my song is right, I will find a way
Find a way
While she lays waiting
I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
Then I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting for me like a secret friend
And there's no end
While she lays crying
I fumble with a melody or two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
And she says to wake her up when I am through
God, her love is true
And she believes in me
I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday, if she was my girl
I could change the world with my little songs
I was wrong
But she has faith in me
And so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe, on some special night

He was in a bind 'cause he was way behind. He was willing to make a deal
When he came across this young man sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot.
And the Devil jumped upon a hickory stump and said ""Boy, let me tell you what.""
""I bet you didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player, too.
And if you'd care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you.
Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the Devil his due.

'Cause Hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards.
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold,
But if you lose the devil gets your soul.
The Devil opened up his case and he said, ""I'll start this show.""
And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow.
And he pulled the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss.
And a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this.
When the Devil finished, Johnny said, ""Well, you're pretty good ol' son,
But sit down in that chair right there and let me show you how it's done.""
""Fire on the Mountain."" Run, boys, run!

Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough.
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no.
The Devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat.
And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet.
Johnny said, ""Devil, just come on back if you ever wanna try again,

She was going to pieces when he walked in the door
She just had to see him, she can't wait no more
To night he'll be with her no matter the cost
As the band plays the last cheater's waltz
And ooo-hoo-ooo don't they sound lonely
And ooo-hoo-ooo don't they play sad
And ooo-hoo-ooo three chord of lonely
Watch how he holds her as they dance
To the last cheater's waltz
He tells her he loves her and the music plays on
He tells her he needs her but someone's at home
The ballgames all over and she knows she's lost

"you decorated my life","kenny rogers","1979","Country","All my life was a paper, once plain, pure and white
Till you moved with your pen, changing moods now and then
Till the balance was right
Then you added some music, every note was in place
And anybody could see all the changes in me
By the look on my face
And you decorated my life, created a world where dreams are apart
And you decorated my life by painting your love all over my heart
You decorated my life
Like a rhyme with no reason in an unfinished song
There was no harmony, life meant nothing to me
Until you came along
And you brought out the colors, what a gentle surprise
Now I'm able to see all the things life can be
Shining soft in your eyes
And you decorated my life, created a world where dreams are apart
And you decorated my life by painting your love all over my heart
You decorated my life"

"coward of the county","kenny rogers","1980","Country","Everyone considered him the coward of the county
He'd never stood one single time to prove the county wrong
His mama called him Tommy, the folks just called him yellow
Something always told me they were reading Tommy wrong
And he was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison
And I took care of Tommy 'cause he was my brother's son
I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy
""Son, my life is over, but yours is just begun""
""Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
Now it don't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
And I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man""
There's someone for everyone and Tommy's love was Becky
In her arms he didn't have to prove he was a man
One day while he was workin' the gatlin' boys came callin'
They took turns at Becky, there we're three of them
Tommy opened up the door and saw his Becky cryin'
The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand
He reached above the fireplace and took down his daddy's picture
As the tears fell on his daddy's face, I heard these words again
""Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
Now it won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
And I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man""
The gatlin' boys just laughed at him when he walked into the barroom
One of them got up and met him halfway 'cross the floor
When Tommy turned around they said, ""Hey look, ol' yellow's leavin'""
You coulda heard a pin drop when Tommy stopped and locked the door
Twenty years of crawlin' was bottled up inside him
He wasn't holdin' nothin' back, he let 'em have it all
When Tommy left the barroom not a gatlin' boy was standin'
He said, ""This one's for Becky,"" as he watched the last one fall
And I heard him say
""I promised you dad, not to do the things you've done
I walked away from trouble when I can
Now please don't think I'm weak, I couldn't turn the other cheek
And papa, I sure hope you understand
Sometimes you gotta fight when you're a man""

Never have I done it when it looked so right

This is down in the swampland, anything goes
It's alligator bait and the bars don't close
It's the real thing down in Louisiana
Did you ever see a Cajun when he really got mad
When he really got trouble like a daughter gone bad
It gets real hot down in Louisiana
The stranger better move it or he's gonna get killed
He's gonna have to get it or a shotgun will

and Lovin' the cowboy ways.
Pursuin' the life of my high-ridin' heroes,
I burned up my childhood days.
I learned all the rules of the modern-day drifter,
Don't you hold on to nothin' too long.
Just take what you need from the ladies, then leave them,
With the words of a sad country song.
My heroes have always been cowboys.
And they still are, it seems.
Sadly, in search of, but one step in back of,
Themselves and their slow-movin' dreams.
Cowboys are special with their own brand of misery,
From being alone too long.
You could die from the cold in the arms of a nightman,
Knowin' well that your best days are gone.
Pickin' up hookers instead of my pen,
I let the words of my years fade away.
Old worn-out saddles, and 'old worn-out memories,
With no one and no place to stay.
My heroes have always been cowboys.
And they still are, it seems.
Sadly, in search of, but one step in back of,
Themselves and their slow-movin' dreams.

"he stopped loving her today","george jones","1980","Country","He said I'll love you till I die
She told him you, you'll forget in time
As the years went slowly by
She still prayed upon his mind
He kept her picture on his wall
Went half crazy now and then
He still loved her through it all
Hoping she'd come back again
Kept some letters by his bed
Dated 1962
He had underlined in red
Every single ""l love you""
I went to see him just today
Oh but i didn't see no tears
All dressed up to go away
First time I'd seen him smile in years
He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today
Ya know she came to see him one last time
Oh we all wondered if she would
And it kept running through my mind
This time he's over her for good
He stopped loving her today

And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today."

On the trouble with a woman an' a man.

Into somethin' that you don't understand.
Still you wonder:
Who's cheatin' who an' who's bein' true?
Who don't even care anymore?
It makes you wonder:
Who's doin' right by someone tonight,
An' whose car is parked next door?
I thought I knew him well; I really coudn't tell,
That he had another lover on his mind.
You see, it felt so right when he held me tight,
How could I be so blind?

Who's cheatin' who an' who's bein' true?
Who don't even care anymore?
It makes you wonder:
Who's doin' right by someone tonight,

Love is stolen in the shadows of the night.

As long as they keep out of sight.

I left my mama a goodbye note
By sundown I'd left Kingston
With my guitar under my coat
I hitchhiked all the way down to Memphis
Got a room at the YMCA
And for the next three weeks , I went huntin' them nights
Just lookin' for a place to play
Well, I thought my pickin'  would set 'em on fire
But nobody wanted to hire a guitar man
Well, I nearly 'bout starved to death down in Memphis
I run outta money and luck
So, I bought me a ride down to Macon, Georgia
On a overloaded poultry truck
I thumbed on down to Panama City
Started pickin' out some o' them all night bars
Hopin' I could make myself a dollar
Makin' music on my guitar
I got the same old story at them all night piers
There ain't no room around here for a guitar man
We don't need a guitar man, son
So, I slept in the hobo jungles
I roamed a thousand miles of track
Till I found myself in Mobile Alabama
At a club they call Big Jack's
A little four-piece band was jammin'
So, I took my guitar and I sat in
I showed 'em what a band would sound like
With a swingin' little guitar man, show 'em, son
If you ever take a trip down to the ocean
Find yourself down around Mobile
Make it on out to a club called Jack's
If you got a little time to kill
Just follow that crowd of people
You'll wind up out on his dance floor
Diggin' the finest little five-piece group
Up and down the Gulf of Mexico
Guess who's leadin' that five-piece band?
Wouldn't ya know
It's that swingin' little guitar man

Then I would not have found you
Angel flying too close to the ground
And I patched up your broken wing and hung around a while
Trying to keep your spirits up and your fever down
I knew someday that you would fly away
For love's the greatest healer to be found
So leave me if you need to, I will still remember
Angel flying too close to the ground
Fly on, fly on past, the speed of sound
I'd rather see you up than see you down
So leave me if you need to, I will still remember
Angel flying too close to the ground.
So leave me if you need to, I will still remember

And I don't ride bulls but I have fought some men
Drive a pickup truck, trust in God and luck
And I live to love Texas women

Till I looked upon those Houston faces
Spent Hollywood nights up in Beverly Hills
But they weren't nothin' like one night down in Brownsville

And I don't ride bulls but I have fought some men
Drive a pickup truck, trust in God and luck

Everyday's another way of feeling more the same
Looks like I'll run out of highway before I out run the rain
But if there's fire and smoke
Ooh, what a rush I got when your love was hot
Oh, but I couldn't see that when the flame burned out
You'd leave a cold dark cloud, a raining down on me
So I'm reaching out to someone wishing, she was you instead
And everything I left behind was waiting up ahead
Pulling on the bottom baby, looking back on you
'Cause anyways the right way babe as long as I pull through
If there's fire and smoke
Ooh, what a rush I got when your love was hot
Oh, but I couldn't see that when the flame burned out
You'd leave a cold dark cloud, a raining down on me

So I thought I'd come up here and see
But all I've seen so far is one big hassle
Wish I was camped out on the Okachovee
If this is the promised land, I've had all I can stand
And I'm headed back below that Dixie line
Well I just don't fit in and I'll never come back again
I'm busted here with Dixie on my mind
Oh, I'm stuck up here and I got Dixie on my mind
These people never smile or say a word
They're all too busy tryin' to make an extra dime
Oh, I'd love to haul 'em all down around Spartanburg
And show 'em how to raise hell in Carolina
Oh, the things you know that I miss most of all
Is the freedom of the rivers and the pines
They don't do much huntin' and fishin' up here, ya know
But I have met a few squirrels and one porcupine
If this is the promised land, I've had all I can stand
Wish I was down in Houston town tonight

Midnight Hauler (1981)
This eighteen-wheeler rolling heavy through the desert tonight
I’ve been driving all day but I won’t shut her down tonight
I just pulled out of Santa Fe I gonna make it home by the break of day
Cause the midnight hauler is cannon balling her home
I got my load strapped sown and my Peter Built is wound up tight
I got my saddle full of diesel and my belly full of coffee and whites
I’ve been talking on the radio keeping track of old Smoky Joe
Cause the midnight hauler is cannon balling her home
I got a little woman waiting back in old KC
Lord that sweet good woman don’t love nobody but old RB
I just called her on the telephone I said tomorrow night you won’t sleep alone
Cause the midnight hauler is cannon balling her home
The highway is deserted it’s a Saturday night
Ain’t nobody but the moon and the trucks in sight
Streaking across the desert like a lightning flash
I’m going home baby got to get there fast
This eighteen-wheeler rolling heavy through the desert tonight
Lord I’ve been driving all day but I won’t shut her down tonight
I just pulled out of Santa Fe I gonna make it home by the break of day

"fourteen carat mind","gene watson","1982","Country","I still recall the morning that I met you
Standing out in front of Wilson's Five and Dime
Staring through the window at the jewelry
Hungry for the things you couldn't buy
Just like a fool I thought that I could please you
I saw you had an eye for things that shine
I paid seven saw mill dollars for a bracelet
Just to satisfy your fourteen carat mind
Layin' by these railroad tracks in Denver
With a hurtin' head and a half a pint of wine
Everything except my soul has been surrendered
Just to satisfy your fourteen carat mind
The cabin that I built in West Virginia
Was not enough to keep you satisfied
'Cause a man that's got a saw mill occupation
Can't afford to feed a rich girls' appetite
I wonder if you're still with Willie Jackson
Sometimes I wonder if he's still alive
Ol' Willie, he gave up his wife and children
Just to satisfy your fourteen carat mind
Layin' by these railroad tracks in Denver
With a hurtin' head and a half a pint of wine
Everything except my soul has been surrendered
Just to satisfy your fourteen carat mind

Many rides on troubled shores

Only made me love you more

When eatin' my cookin' got the better of me,
So I asked this little girl I was goin' with to be my wife.
Well, she said she would, so I said “I do”.
But I'da said I wouldn't if I'da just knew
How sayin' “I do” was gonna screw up all of my life!
Well, the first few years weren't all that bad â ""
I'll never forget the good times we had
Cause I'm reminded every month when I send her the child support.
Well, it wasn't too long till the lust all died,
And I'll admit I wasn't too surprised
The day I come home and found my suitcase sittin' out on the porch.
Well, I tried to get in â "" she changed the locks!
Then I found this note taped on the mailbox
That said, “Goodbye, turkey! My attorney will be in touch!” Mm-hmm…
So I decided right then and there
I's gonna do what's right â "" give her her fair share.
But brother â "" I didn't know her share's gon' be THAT much!
She got the gold mine! She got the gold mine!
I got the shaft. I got the shaft.
They split it right down the middle,
And then they give her the better half.
Well, it all sounds sorta funny,
But it hurts too much to laugh.
She got the gold mine - I got the sha-a-aft.
Now, listen â "" you ain't heard nothin' yet:
Why, they give her the color television set,
Then they give her the house, the kids, and both of the cars! See?
Well, then they start talkin' ‘bout child support,
Alimony, and the cost of the court â ""
Didn't take me long to figure out how far in the toilet I was!
I'm tellin' ya, they have made a mistake
Cause it adds up to more than this cowboy makes!
Besides; everything I ever had worth takin', they've already took!
While she's livin' like a queen on alimony,
I'm workin' two shifts eatin' baloney,
Askin' myself, “Why didn't you just learn how to cook?!?!”
They give her the gold mine! She got the gold mine!
They give me the shaft. I got the shaft.
They said they're splittin' it all down the middle,
But she got the better half.
Well, it all sounds mighty funny,
But it hurts too much to laugh.

Well, she got the gold mine! She got the gold mine!

Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore
And if love never lasts forever
Tell me what's forever for

Tryin' their best to survive
When right there in their hands
Is a dying romance
And they're not even trying to keep it alive

Just like a beautiful song I can't get off my mind
But I worry alot about love you have to wait on
And I got second thoughts about a woman who is always gone
Chorus:
She said I can be had but I can't be bought
and I can be bad lord if I don't get caught
but I'd rather be loved than left alone
than be here in the middle some where between right and wrong"

His sweet love, no more I'll share
Now he's gone, I'm alone, I was wrong, should have known
Took me home on our last date
I search for a single way to tell him what I had to say
I kissed him, watched him, walk away
Set him free, foolishly, destiny, misery
Tragedy, on our last date
Took the ring from my trembling fingers
Brushed a tear from my baby's eye
Walked away, didn't know that I'd soon miss him so
Guess, I was too young to realize
So blind, I couldn't see, how much, he really meant to me
And that soon he would always be
On my mind, in my heart, I was blind from the start

'Cause I know inside, what she can't bring herself to say
There's something dying deep in her heart, I feel it when I touch her hand
So I tell her a lie, when I tell her I understand
But inside I die a little each day
Inside I feel her slipping away
Inside if she knew I hurt this way
Inside she'd find a reason to stay
And so I must keep this broken heart down deep inside
She turns to look at me, trying to speak her mind
A thousand reasons in search of a single rhyme
And suddenly it occurs to me, she's trying to say goodbye
So I give her a smile and tell her that I'll be alright
But inside I die a little each day
Inside, I feel her slipping away
Inside, if she knew I hurt this way
Inside, she'd find a reason to stay

Is it something that's said or is it instead
Something that just simply dies?

And that it drowns the tender reed
And some say love, it's like a razor
And that it leaves your soul to bleed.
Some say love, it is a hunger
An endless aching need
I say love, it is a flower
And you, it's only seed.
It's a heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's a dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance
It's the one who won't be taken
Who can not seem to give
And the soul afraid of dying
That never learns to live.
When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong
Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snows
Lies the seed that with the sun's love
In spring becomes the rose..."

I asked her friends about her but all their lips were tight.
Lucille, won't you do your daddy's will
Oh Lucille, just won't you do your daddy's will
Well, it ain't nothin' to you, I love you still.
Oh Lucille, please come back where you belong

"highway 40 blues","ricky skaggs","1983","Country","Well, these Highway 40 blues
I've walked holes in both my shoes
Counted the days since I've been gone
And I'd love to see the lights of home
Wasted time and money too
Squandered youth in search of truth
But in the end I had to lose
Lord above, I've paid my dues
Got the Highway 40 blues
The highway called when I was young
Told me lies of things to come
Fame and fortune lies ahead
That's what the billboard lights had said
Shattered dreams, my mind is numb
My money's gone, stick out my thumb
My eyes are filled with bitter tears
Lord, I ain't been home in years
Got the Highway 40 blues
You know, I've rambled all around
Like a rolling stone, from town to town
Met pretty girls I have to say
But none of them could make me stay
Well, I've played the music halls and bars
Had fancy clothes and big fine cars
Things a country boy can't use
Dixieland I sure miss you
Got the Highway 40 blues"

"pancho and lefty","willie nelson merle haggard","1983","Country","Living on the road my friend, is gonna keep you free and clean.
Now you wear your skin like iron, and your breath is hard as kerosene.
You weren't your mama's only boy, but her favourite one it seems.
She began to cry when you said goodbye, and sank into your dreams.
Pancho was a bandit boy, his horse was fast as polished steel.
He wore his gun outside his pants, for all the honest world to feel.
Pancho met his match, you know, on the deserts down in Mexico.
Nobody heard his dying words; ah, but that's the way it goes.
All the Federales say,
They could have had him any day.
They only let him slip away,
Out of kindness, I suppose.
Lefty, he can't sing the blues all night long like he used to.
The dust that Pancho bit down south ended up in Lefty's mouth.
The day they laid poor Pancho low, Lefty split for Ohio.
Where he got the bread to go, there ain't nobody knows.
All the Federales say,
They could have had him any day.
They only let him slip away,
Out of kindness, I suppose.
The poets tell how Pancho fell, and Lefty's living in cheap hotels.
The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold, and so the story ends we're told.
Pancho needs your prayers it's true, but save a few for Lefty too.
He only did what he had to do, and now he's growing old.
(All the Federales say,
They could have had him any day.)
They only let him go so long,
Out of kindness, I suppose.
A few grey Federales say
They could have had him any day.
They only let him go so long,
Out of kindness, I suppose."

To know him

Well he would sure be shocked if he could see me sipping ice tea and watching TV
It's Saturday night and I'm taking it easy home alone with you

When ever I check in he winks and grins at the latest Mrs Smith I'm with
Now he probably won't believe it's true when he hears I gave a ring to you
Cause there'll be no more motel rendezvous for this Mr Smith

A lady down on love and out of hope and dreams
The ties that once bound her, now are broke away
And she's like a baby just learning how to play
She never thought that love could ever end so soon
Her mind drifts back in time to a mid-summer moon
When he asked her to marry and she gladly said okay
And a woman came to be from the girl of yesterday
Now she's a lady, down on love
She needs somebody to gently pick her up
She's got her freedom, but she'd rather be bound
To a man who would love her and never let her down
Well I know the lady that's down on her love
'Cause I used to hold her and have that special touch
But work took me away from home late at nights
And I wasn't there when she turned out the lights
Then both of us got lonely and I gave into lust
And she just couldn't live with a man she couldn't trust

She's got her freedom, but she'd rather be bound
To a man who would love her, never let her down

Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart

It requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
We ride it together, ah ha
Making love with each other, ah ha

That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, ah ha
From one lover to another, ah ha
I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing if you got no one
And you just walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt

Don't you have any friends at all
I never hear a knocking at your door
Could it be you just don't try anymore?
You've been hurt so seriously
You act so cold but it's so easy to see
You're a waste of real good love
But you can't hide or run fast enough
Somebody's gonna love you, no matter what you do
Somebody's gonna find all the pieces of a broken heart
Hidden inside of you
Somebody's gonna touch you, it's just a matter of time
And if you're ever gonna try love again, it might as well be mine
I know exactly how a heartache feels
It's gonna take a little time to heal
Why must you hide away inside yourself
If you could mean so much to someone else?
Every night when you're sittin' at home
You may be lonely but you're not alone
There's a whole world full of people out there
Waiting on someone like you to care
Somebody's gonna love you, no matter what you do
Somebody's gonna find all the pieces of a broken heart
Hidden inside of you

I'm going home to see
Though other men have held her
Her heart belongs to me
You've traveled down some dusty roads
Slept out in the rain
But this yellow rose is always here
When you come home again
She knows I've done some hard time
You stumbled then you fell
I just kept your pride from dying
You saved my soul from hell
She's the diamond of the desert
She's the golden flower of spring
She's the yellow rose of Texas
She can make a man a king
There's a yellow rose in Texas
She knows the dues I've paid
And I'm going home to tell her
I wish I'd never strayed
You couldn't see beyond yourself
Your pain and wounded pride
But now you know the truth is
In the way you feel in side
She knows I've done some hard time
You stumbled then you fell
I just kept your pride from dying
And you saved my soul from hell

For all the days gone by.

To hurt sometimes.

But time won't let you stay
But for every step you take
You lose something on the way
You can't look forward to tomorrow
And still hold on to yesterday

Stepped into an evening rain
Made my way down the avenue
Softly whispering your name

Something inside of me is still losing you
Maybe, someday I'll learn to live with this regret
'Til then my heart will go on trying to forget

Sometimes I remember when I stay up late at night
When the summer came, we got up and went
and the shadows of a workin' day
our moonlight hour spent singing songs along with grandma's radio.
Now I've beaten down an old blacktop road
and sleepin' in a sack
living up my memories all in vain
Cause those city lights ain't all that bright
Compared to what it's like
to see lightning bugs go dancing in the rain
Mama played the guitar then
and daddy made the sawblade bend
and raindrops played the tin roof like a drum

Takes me down a road to where my name is known
Now I'm gone and it's a long, hard road.

High on the hill, an' above the town
Uncle Pen played the fiddle, Lord, how it rang
You could hear it talk, you could hear it sing
I'll never forget that mournful day
When old Uncle Pen was called away
He hung up his fiddle and he hung up his bow
And he knew it was time for him to go
Late in the evening, about sundown
High on the hill, an' above the town

"city of new orleans","willie nelson","1984","Country","Riding on the city of New Orleans
Illinois Central, Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail
All along the southbound odyssey
The train pulled out at Kankakee
And rolls along past houses, farms and fields
Passin' trains that have no names
And freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles
Good morning, America
How are you?
Say don't you know me? I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the city of New Orleans
And I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done
Dealin' card games with the old men in the club car
Penny a point ain't no one keepin' score
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor
And the sons of Pullman Porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpet made of steel
Mothers with their babes asleep
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rail is all they feel
Good morning, America
How are you?
Say don't you know me? I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the city of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done
Nighttime on the city of New Orleans
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee
Half way home, we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness
Rolling down to the sea
But all the towns and people seem
To fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings his songs again
The passengers will please refrain
This train has got the disappearing railroad blues
Good morning, America
How are you?
Say don't you know me? I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the city of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done"

You Could've Heard a Heartbreak

I watch those disappearing wedding rings
A telephone call pagin' so and so
There he is shakin' his head no
'Cause he's got this girl hangin' all over him
He can't quit now, he's gone out on a limb
Then the place turns quiet as a mummy's tomb
Guess who happened to walk in the room

You could've heard a tear drop
I feel so bad for her sake
Now what's she gonna do
The chances that a fool takes
Never knowin' when to stop
You could've heard a heart break
Breakin' right in two
She walks on over
Tears in her eyes
And knows she's gonna hear a pack of lies
The silence is deafening
All eyes are on her
What will she say to that innocent girl
Her hands start shakin'
'Cause the words don't come
She's in shock, her whole body is numb
Everyone there is holdin' their breath
With the slightest whisper, we'll know what she says
You could've heard a heart break

There is one thing that I realize
That there's no doubt in my mind

They could take a long-haired country boy and softly bend his mind
Made love in New York City where they dress in silk and pearls
But Lord I swear there's nothing anywhere

Cause country girls are sweeter'n a tube full of honey
And country girls are warmer than the Georgia sun
They know how to touch you, they know how to love you
Take you right out of this world
I'm so glad that God made country girls
There's women in Chicago in their high rise penthouse rooms
With fine champagne and other things you could drown in their perfume
But I'll take a night down in Mobile, just looking out across the bay
With a country girl lying next to me, taking my breath away

We're alone together I may turn to you and say
There's something I forgot to tell you and by now I think you'll know

Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around, I'll always be around and around
And around and around and around
I fly a starship across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain

Love ain't just a rule
A distant far away dream
That needs the night to rise

And love ain't just a song
Sweet words of music
To go dancin' by
Love is a man and he's mine
Oh, love is alive
And at breakfast table
Everyday of the week
Love is alive
And it grows everyday and night
Even in our sleep
Love is alive
And it's made a happy woman out of me

Love is alive, here by me

"modern day romance","nitty gritty dirt band","1985","Country","We met on the highway, she flagged me down,
Had a flat on her stingray with nobody around
I helped her out, she said climb in
So I ditched my ol truck just to see where the party would end.
We spent the weekend in reno in the honeymoon suite,
Never saw the casino, barely took time to eat.
I never dreamed she would take me this far
But by sunday that lady had taken a hold of my heart.
It's a modern day romance, a new kind of game
With no time to slow dance in the fast lane.
I tried to love her without any strings
But a modern day romance has left me some old-fashioned pain.
She never said good-bye, just a note by the phone
Said ""thanks for the good times, but it's time to move on.""
Well I'm out here walkin' with my thumb in the air
Wondering where she might've gone and why I even care.
It's a modern day romance; old fashioned pain"

Like the first time you were with me and my heart just came undone
Lying here this morning boy I know you're still the one
I fell in love again last night
You keep doing everything just right
You're the reason my heart keeps beating
And every morning it keeps repeating
I fell in love again last night
We were talking about some future plans
And how far we've come together since the night it all began
Then you reached out to touch me and guess what happened then
I fell in love again last night

"tomb of the unknown love","kenny rogers","1986","Country","One time I drove to see a girl across the country
One night as I was driving through to Mexico
I had the windows wide open, it was cold and I was crying
And I later laid her on the radio
Then I stopped that side of Tahoe through this tiny mining town
At a diner to be filled for the ride
And in the wind I heard this crying, like a heart broke cried a tune
I turned my collar up and went inside
Well, I saw this smiling waitress joshing friendly with these truckers
That give her pats and she gives them shoves
I said, ""Miss, watch that awful crying"", everybody laughed and said
""It's the tomb of the unknown love""
And then they pointed out the window to this stone
All by myself, beneath the tree, beside the hill
And on that winter night I read these words alone
These words that are haunting me still, it said
Here lies a young man, struck down in his prime
By the awesome burning power of love
He couldn't stand this true love cheating, so he shot the girl down
They hung him from that tree up above
I know that local folks say it's the wind
But I know it's crying from the tomb of the unknown love
So I drove on to my destination
I did the job my heart commanded of me
And when the sheriff sirens came up, I did believe and tried to find
They counted ten, I came out at three
So now I guess tomorrow morning, warden reads some kind of paper
How I'm gonna pay the state for what I've done
Hey, didn't they put their shackles on me and they'll take a little walk
They won't have to drag me â€~cos it's said and done
And maybe someday they can put me at this stone
All by itself, beneath the tree, beside the hill
And lovers everywhere can come and meet alone
These words that forgive them up to, and it'll say
Here lies a young man, struck down in his prime
By the awesome burning power of love

She says that you're just a one-night man and you'll end up hurting me

She says I'll find a love some day but you're just not the one

"everything that glitters is not gold","dan seals","1986","Country","Saw your picture on a poster, in a cafe out in Phoenix
Guess you're still the sweet heart of the rodeo
As for me and little Casey, we still make the circuit
In a one horse trailer and a mobile home
And she still asks about you all the time
And I guess we never even cross your mind
But oh sometimes I think about you
And the way you used to ride out
In your rhinestones and your sequins
With the sunlight on your hair
And oh the crowd will always love you
But as for me I've come to know
Everything that glitters is not gold
Well old Red he's getting older, and last Saturday he stumbled
But you know I just can't bear to let him go
Little Casey she's still growing and she's started asking questions
And there's certain things a man just doesn't know
Her birthday came and you never even called
I guess we never cross your mind at all
But then sometimes I think about you
And the way you used to ride out
In your rhinestones and your sequins
With the sunlight on your hair
And oh the crowd will always love you
But as for me I've come to know
Everything that glitters is not gold
Everybody said you'd make it big someday
And I guess that we were only in your way
But someday I'm sure your gonna know the cost
Cause for everything you win there's something lost
But oh sometimes I think about you
And the way you used to ride out
In your rhinestones and your sequins
With the sunlight on your hair
And oh the crowd will always love you
But as for me I've come to know
Everything that glitters is not gold"

"born to boogie","hank williams jr","1987","Country","Well my momma met my daddy down in Alabama
They tied the knot so here I am
Born on the bayou on the Texas Line
Loved Louisanana and raised on Jabalaya
Now before I could walk I had a guitar in my hand by the time I could talk I had my own band
Went on the road when I was eight years old when I turned fifteen I was stealing the show
Money to burn and the girls were pretty it didn't take me long to learn that I was born to boogie
When I was eighteen I went to Hollywood I met Elvis, Marilyn and Johnny B. Goode
Got my guitar painted in the California sun a red caddilac having to much fun
Now we were playing them halls and jammin' then until they moved me on over to M.G.M
They said this is the boy we've been telling you about, he lit a cigar and stuck his hand out
He said son have we got a deal for you gonna make you a star give you fifty thousand too
I told him my Momma didn't raise no fool
I'll take your money, I'll make you a movie
But I can tell ya' right now I am born to boogie
Well my name is Bocephus I drink whiskey by the gallon and I never back down and I love a good chall
What I do now is what I did then I like to get down with all my rowdy friends
Now I can be sweet and I can be mean I still got my hat and I still wear my jeans
My shades are chromo my guitar is steal if you think I won't then believe me I will
Get down on you baby because I ain't no rookie I was put here to party and I was born to boogie"

And if just by snappin' your fingers
You could snap them fingers and make it all go away
Honey, now would ya?
Do ya miss me when I'm gone but sometimes wish
That I'd stay gone just a little bit longer?
Well, I guess what I'm askin'
Is do you still love me?
'Cause honey, I sure do still love you
At least I think I do
And these questions I'm askin'
You could ask them of me too
Do ya still get a thrill
When ya see me comin' up the hill
Honey, now do ya? Oh, do ya?
Do ya whisper my name
Just to bring a little comfort to ya?
Do ya?
Do you still like the feel
Of my body lyin' next to ya?
Whoa, oa, oa, yeah
Well, I guess what I'm askin'
Is do you still love me?
Yes, I guess what I'm askin'
Is do ya still love me, do ya?
Do ya? Oh, do ya? Tell me, do ya?"

Every night seemed like a lifetime
The clock upon the wall
Never seemed to move at all or was it just my mind?
Now with you here in my arms
I wanna make it last
But the time is flying by
And the morning's coming fast
Where do the nights go when I'm with you?
Where do the nights go
When I wanna kiss you and hold you tight?
Is this what love feels like?
Your heart beats like thunder every moment you wonder
Where do the nights go?
Where do the nights, where do the nights go?
If I had a time machine
I'd make the daylight seem like fleeting moments
And every single night
Would be exactly like the night that we spent
But it won't be long until
I'm alone with my desire
'Cause the stars are going out
And my heart is still on fire
Tell me, where do the nights go when I'm with you?
Where do the nights go?
Where do the nights, where do the nights go?

Giving guidance with its light

As I wandered through the night
From the first time that I saw you
Standing silent by the shore
I knew my search was over
And I would look for love no more
Deep in the waters of love I am falling
Sinking like a stone
Deep in my heart I can hear love calling
Goin' once, goin' twice, goin' gone
Goin' once, goin' twice, goin' gone
There's a ship on the horizon
Making its way against the wind
From the place where I stand watching
I swear my ship is coming in, oh

Sinking like a stone

Some people are born to live alone
And go about life that way,
Their home is a long stretch
Of blacktop and everyday,
Is just another day,
They like movin' and stayin on the run
And tryin' to make the world stand still
White lines and city limit signs
And life is like an automobile's
Rollin' down the highway what a fine time
That's the only way to feel

Wheels,
Stay under me,
Stay under me
Wheels,
Stay under me,
Stay under me

It's a freedom that we all wanna know
It's an obsession to some
To keep the world in your rearview mirror
While you try to run down the sun
It's the knowin' when you
Get to where you're goin'
You're never there against your will
White lines and city limit signs

Rollin' down the highway what a fine time
That's the only way to feel

Were slippin' away from home and puttin' jewelery in hock
To take the trip, to go and listen
To the little dark haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box
And he would play
Well, he couldn't ride or wrangle, and he never cared to make a dime
But give him his guitar, and he'd be happy all the time
And all the girls from nine to ninety
Were snapping fingers, tapping toes, and begging him, don't stop
And hypnotized and fascinated
By the little dark haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box
And he would play
And one day he was gone, and no one ever saw him 'round
He'd vanished like the breeze, they forgot him in the little town
But all the girls still dreamed about him
And hung around the cabaret until the doors were locked
And then one day on the hit parade
Was a little dark haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box

It's Such A Small World (1988)
Fancy meeting you here tonight
It’s such a small world, New York ain’t my town
I don’t come around but once in a while
This is such a surprise to see you
Girl you’re looking so good it’s been a long time
Since you crossed my mind it’s such a small world
Just one night on the town
I came looking around for something to do
Just a change of my plans only bad
And I stay around and I run into you
Which just goes to prove it’s such a small world
It’s such a small world I’ll live alone for a while
It’s such a small world it feels like I’ve gone out of style
You and me will always be
Just looking for something that’s already happened
Years go by but you and I
Don’t have to look beyond today
Maybe just for tonight we can turn out the lights
Lay your heart on the line let go of your mind
You’ll know just what to say, you’ll know just what to do
You still look like the day when I first met you
I’ll be gone once again come morning
Like I’ve always done but to see you tonight
Makes everything right it’s such a small world
And right here you stand as if it were planned it’s such a small world"

That he never told her,
And he forgets to hold her
When she needs him sometimes
The promises he made her
He never got around to
Still the thought of leavin'
Never crossed her mind.

What she has, she thinks is enough
What she does is just look at the good things
And what she is, is a woman in love.
He forgets to call her,
So he keeps her waiting,
He's always breaking the plans that she's made,
There's so many good things
That he never gave her
But it never mattered to her anyway,

What she has, she thinks is enough
And what she does is just look at the good things
And what she is, is a woman in love

And she's looking at him with her heart
And not her eyes.

I Told You So
(Randy Travis)
Suppose I called you up tonight and told you that I loved you
And suppose I said ""I wanna come back home"".
And suppose I cried and said ""I think I finally learned my lesson""
And I'm tired a-spendin' all my time alone.
If I told you that I realised you're all I ever wanted
And it's killin' me to be so far away.
Would you tell me that you loved me too and would we cry together?
Or would you simply laugh at me and say:
""I told you so, oh I told you so
I told you some day you come crawling back and asking me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
Now I found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again"".
If I got down on my knees and told you I was yours forever
Would you get down on yours to and take my hand?
Would we get that old time feelin', would we laugh and talk for hours 
The way we did when our love first began?
Would you tell me that you'd missed me too and that you'd been so lonely
And you waited for the day that I return.
And we'd live in love forever and that I'm your one and only
Or would you say the tables finally turned?
Would you say:
""I told you so, oh I told you so
I told you some day you come crawling back and asking me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
Now I found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again"".
""Now I found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again""."

"runaway train","rosanne cash","1988","Country","I'm worried about you, I'm worried about me
Curves around midnight aren't easy to see
Flashing red warnings unseen in the rain
This thing has turned into a runaway train
Long-distance phone calls, a voice on the line
Electrical miles that soften the time
Dynamite too is hooked on the wire
And so are the rails of American fliers
Blind boys and gamblers, they invented the blues
Will pay up in blood when this marker comes due
To try and get off now it's about as insane
As those who wave lanterns at runaway trains
Steel rails and hard lives
Are always in two's
I have been here before this
And now it's with you
I'm worried about you, I'm worried about me
We're lighting the fuses and counting to three
And what are the choices for those who remain
The sign of the cross on a runaway train
This thing has turned into a runaway train
This thing has turned into a runaway train
Our love has turned into a runaway train"

If we never meet again before my life is over
I'll leave this world loving you
You can take everything, but my memories
For they're good ones and they'll see me through
If we never meet again I'll love you forever
I'll leave this world loving you
You were mine for a time and I'm thankful
Oh, but life would be so lonesome without you
If we never meet again this side of heaven
I'll leave this world loving you
If we never meet again this side of heaven
I'll leave this world loving you"

A ghost from my past

She must be his new love

It's just
I know how he feels, how warm his touch is
Oh how he feels, how soft his kiss is
And it cuts right down to the bone
'Cause I let him go
I know how he cares, how strong his love can be
When he believes it's real
Oh I've been there
And I know how he feels
As long as I kept him out of sight
I kept from goin' out of my mind
Tried to believe that leavin' him
Was somehow justified
But tonight there's no denying
What a love like his is worth?
He once looked at me the way he's lookin' at her
What a lucky girl!
I know how he feels, how warm his touch is

And that would not do justice to the way I feel for you

Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill
My love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late December
And honest as a robin on a springtime window sill
And longer than the song of a whippoorwill
From the backroads to the Broadway shows with a million miles between

"big wheels in the moonlight","dan seals","1989","Country","I came from a town that was so small
You look both ways, you could see it all
All I wanted was some way out
Every evening I'd slip into town
And stand around by the caution light
And watch the big trucks rolling by
For me it was a beautiful sight
Big wheels in the moonlight
I had a case of wanderlust
I'd lie awake with the windows up
Out on Highway Fifty Nine
I could hear some big old diesel whine
She was going through all the gears
And headed out to who knows where
I fell asleep 'most every night
Dreaming about big wheels in the moonlight
And I want to put my life on the centerline
And I want to see the world before I die
And I know that there's a peace I'll never find
'Cause those big old wheels keep rolling through my mind
How I got here, it's hard to say
So many things got in my way
Can't complain about all I've got
Kids and a wife and a regular job
But at night when I'm sitting here
All alone in a living room chair
Sometimes I close my eyes
And see big wheels in the moonlight
And I want to put my life on the centerline
And I want to see the world before I die
And I know that there's a peace I'll never find
'Cause those big old wheels keep rolling through my mind
And I want to put my life on the centerline
And I want to see the world before I die
And I know that there's a peace I'll never find
'Cause those big old wheels keep rolling through my mind

As they are on this damned old L.A. street

And laid his head against my chest
Please Lord, take his soul back home to Dixie

Run back home to that Southern land
Don't you see what life here has done to me

And fell limp against my side
No more pain, now he's safe back home in Dixie

I believed every single word you said

That you loved somebody else, instead
I know you've got a right to find someone new

Where did I go wrong? Where did he go right?
And now I'd won the battle if I'd known there was a fight
I can't stand the thought of never holding you tight
Where did I go wrong and he go right?
There was something all around us
Like I'd never felt before
Guess I should've seen it coming
I was busy comin' back for more
I know you've got a right to change your mind
Well, I got a right to be losing mine

Things I couldn't do before now I think I can
And I'm leavin' here a better man

Oh I want you to know that I took a rainbow
And sent it off in a letter to you
I took some flowers in the spring made a sweet clover ring
And sent it off in a letter to you
I took a song from the lark, the moon from the dark
And a spark with the sparkling dew
With a kiss and a hug and a whole lot of love
I sent 'em off in a letter to youI took the mornin' sun peekin' through the trees
And the dandelion silk tangled in the breeze
I folded 'em up and I sealed 'em with a kiss

"sunday in the south","shenandoah","1989","Country","Mill worker houses lined up in a row
Another southern Sunday's morning glow
Beneath the steeple all the people have begun
Shakin' hands with the man who grips the gospel gun
While the quiet prayer, the smell of dinner on the ground
Heals up the morning air, ain't nothin' sweeter around
I can almost hear my mama pray
""Oh lord forgive us when we doubt
Another sacred Sunday in the southâ€
A ragged rebel flag flies high above it all
Poppin' in the wind like an angry cannon ball
The holes of history are cold and still
But they smell the powder burnin' and they probably always will
And on the old town square under the barber shop pole
They sat me up in the chair when I was four years old
I can almost hear my papa say
""Won't you hold still son? Stop squirmn' around
Another southern Sunday's coming downâ€
I can almost hear the old folks say
""You'll make it big one day, you'll leave this town
Some other lazy Sunday you'll come back aroundâ€
I can feel the evening sun go down
And all the lights in the houses one by one go out
Softly in the distance nothing stirs about
And the night is filled with the sound of a whip-poor-will
On a Sunday in the south, alright
Just another Sunday
Just another Sunday in the south
Oh, another sacred Sunday in the south

How I missed those ol' sweet Sundays in the south
Another sacred Sunday

You've got to have an ace in the hole
If you're headed down a one way street
And you're not sure it's the way you wanna go
In money or love or all the above
Have a little more than what you show
When life deals out a surprise
Have a few surprises of your own
No matter what you do, no matter where you go
You've got to have an ace in the hole
You've got to have an ace in the hole
A little secret that nobody knows
Life is a gamble, a game we all play
But you need to save something for a rainy day
You've got to learn to play your cards right
If you expect to win in life
Don't put it all on the line for just one roll
You've got to have an ace in the hole
Don't put it all on the line for just one roll
You've got to have an ace in the hole
No matter what you do, no matter where you go
You've got to have an ace in the hole"

I used to love him that ain't no lie
We had a good thing till he said goodbye
Then with one touch you set my heart ablaze
I'm burnin' old memories with a brand new flame
A perfect match that's what we are
I'm gettin' over him underneath the stars
The smoke has cleared from the hold he had on me
I'm burnin' old memories with a brand new flame
One by one those old embers burn
You came along when I had no where to turn
Just when I thought I'd never love again
I'm burnin' old memories with a brand new flame
When I'm with you I'm without a doubt
We got a fire I don't ever want to put out
And here with you is where I'm gonna stay

"bayou boys","eddy raven","1989","Country","Passion in the backseat, parked out in the cane
Ever since the first time, I ain't ever been the same
I gave up on baseball and I threw down my glove
I discovered girls and I got into love
Me and my friend Aldo, he's the one who had the car
We made all the dances, we made all the bars
Told each other secrets and we wore each other's clothes
One night I stole his woman and I wonder if he knows
Sleep all day, run all night
Chasing the ladies 'cause we knew they might
We raised a lot of hell, we made a lot of noise
Everybody knew, we were Bayou boys
Everybody knew, we were Bayou boys
Sweet, Marie was dangerous with those dark seductive eyes
She had me sayin', 'maybe, baby' before I realized
She loved me so deeply and I tried to hold on
But changin' don't come easy when you've been this way so, lo"

Yellow Roses
Hello you said the day we met
Handing me a yellow rose
You asked me out
And to your surprise
And to mine i said i'd go
I thought it so romantic
And i found you sweet and bold
Though we'd only met
I still said yes
To a single yellow rose
And for years to come
You were the one
To sleep with me at night
To laugh and talk
And share my thoughts
And hold me when i'd cry
And on every occasion
And for no good reason to
A big bouquet or a single yellow rose
Was sent from you
Chorus:
Yellow roses
The color of sunshine
You loved me at one time
Why did you have to go
Yellow roses
Are you sending your new love
My bright yellow rose buds
I still love you so
I never see a yellow rose
That i didn't think of you
It's still my favorite flower
Though the yellow's turned to blue
The day you left my teardrops fell
Upon your farewell not
You said goodbye like you said hello
With a single yellow rose
Chorus:
Yellow roses
The color of sunshine
You loved me at one time
Why did you have to go
Yellow roses
Are you sending your new love
My bright yellow rose buds
Oh i still love you so
Yellow roses
The color of sunshine
You loved me at one time
Why did you have to go
Sweet yellow roses
Are you sending your new love
My bright yellow rose buds
I still love you so"

Miscellaneous
If Tomorrow Never Comes
Sometimes late at night 
I lie awake and watch her sleeping 
She's lost in peaceful dreams 
So I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark 
And the thought crosses my mind 
If I never wake up in the morning 
Would she ever doubt the way I feel 
About her in my heart 
If tomorrow never comes 
Will she know how much I loved her 
Did I try in every way 
To show her every day 
That she's my only one 
If my time on earth were through 
And she must face the world without me 
Is the love I gave her in the past 
Gonna be enough to last 
If tomorrow never comes 
'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life 
Who never knew how much I loved them 
Now I live with the regret 
That my true feelings for them never were revealed 
So I made a promise to myself 
To say each day how much she means to me 
And avoid that circumstance 
Where there's no second chance 
To tell her how I feel 
If tomorrow never comes 
Will she know how much I loved her 
Did I try in every way 
To show her every day 
That she's my only one 
If my time on earth were through 
And she must face the world without me 
Is the love I gave her in the past 
Gonna be enough to last 
If tomorrow never comes 
So tell that someone that you love 
Just what you're thinking of 
If tomorrow never comes"
"two dozen roses","shenandoah","1989","Country","I brought flowers to your door last night
I done you wrong and I want to make it right
You said I'm not welcome here
I know it ought to be perfectly clear
But I can't help, but wonder what it might be like
If I had two dozen roses and an old bottle of wine
If I really could've hung the moon, would it change your mind
If I could cry a little harder and get a little less sleep at night
If I had two dozen roses, would it change your mind
Oh I must have been a fool back then
To lose something that you can't have again
I've done all that I know to do
And second guessed my every move
But I can't help but wonder how it might have been
If I had two dozen roses and an old bottle of wine
If I really could've hung the moon, would it change your mind
If I could cry a little harder and get a little less sleep at night

Put my blue jeans on
Find my cowboy boots, my button down
Strap my timepiece on my arm
Grab my billfold, my pocket change
Just a mindless old routine
Then it's out the door and down the street
But it's not really me
I still comb my hair the same
Still like the same cologne
And I still drive that pick-up truck
That the same old bank still owns
But since you left, everybody says
I'm not the guy they've known
The lights are on
But nobody's home
Cup of coffee in the morning
It's just food for the brain
But I've been numb since our last goodbye
I haven't felt a thing
But now there's pains in my head
And pains in my chest
And I think I'm losing my hair
I'm a half a man with half a mind
To think you didn't care
I still comb my hair the same
Still like the same cologne
And I still drive that pick-up truck
That the same old bank still owns

And let my mind just go and drift away

Somewhere we can go and escape

Well, I've cried my last tear for you, wasted my last year on you
There's no trace of the heartache I knew
It's been raining pain since you walked out, baby, that's all over now
'Cause I cried my last tear for you
Well, I used to lay alone in bed, with my pillow soaken wet
And all of those lonely nights, I thought there was no end in sight
I cried my heart out over you, then I cried the hurt out too
It took a while but now I'll be all right
Well, I've cried my last tear for you, wasted my last year on you
There's no trace of the heartache I knew
Well, it's been raining pain since you walked out, baby, that's all over now

"love without end amen","george strait","1990","Country","I got sent home from school one day with a shiner on my eye
Fightin' was against the rules and it didn't matter why
When dad got home I told that story just like I'd rehearsed
Then stood there on those tremblin' knees and waited for the worst
And he said, ""Let me tell you a secret about a father's love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us""
He said, ""Daddies don't just love their children
Every now and then, it's a love without end, amen
It's a love without end, amen""
When I became a father in the spring of '81
There was no doubt that stubborn boy was just like my father's son
And when I thought my patience had been tested to the end
I took my daddy's secret and passed it on to him
I said, ""Let me tell you a secret about a father's love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us""
I said, ""Daddies don't just love their children
Every now and then, it's a love without end, amen
It's a love without end, amen""
Last night I dreamed I died and stood outside those pearly gates
When suddenly I realized there must be some mistake
If they know half the things I''ve done, they'll never let me in
Then somewhere from the other side I heard these words again
And they said, ""Let me tell you a secret about a father's love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us
You see daddies don't just love their children
Every now and then, it's a love without end, amen
It's a love without end, amen"""

Our lives are better left to chance
I could have missed the pain
But I'd have had to miss the dance
Holding you, I held everything
For a moment wasn't I a king

And the feel of a muddy row between my toes

And mom would sing amazing grace, while she hung out the clothes

And the smell of Sunday supper on the stove
My footsteps carry me away
But in my mind I'm always going home
Now the miles I put behind me ain't as hard as the miles that lay ahead
And it's way too late to listen to the words of wisdom that my daddy said
But the straight and narrow path he showed me
Turned into a thousand winding roads

Unanswered Prayers
Just the other night at a hometown football game 
My wife and I ran into my old high school flame 
And as I introduced them the past came back to me 
And I couldn't help but think of the way things used to be 
She was the one that I'd wanted for all times 
And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine 
And if he'd only grant me this wish I wished back then 
I'd never ask for anything again 
CHORUS: 
Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers 
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs 
That just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care 
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers 
She wasn't quite the angel that I remembered in my dreams 
And I could tell that time had changed me 
In her eyes too it seemed 
We tried to talk about the old days 
There wasn't much we could recall 
I guess the Lord knows what he's doin' after all 
And as she walked away and I looked at my wife 
And then and there I thankedd the good Lord 
For the gifts in my life

The Thunder Rolls
Three thirty in the morning 
Not a soul in sight 
The city's lookin' like a ghost town 
On a moonless summer night 
Raindrops on the windshield 
There's a storm movin' in 
He's headin' back from somewhere 
That he never should have been 
And the thunder rolls 
And the thunder rolls 
Every light is burnin' 
In a house across town 
She's pacin' by the telephone 
In her faded flannel gown 
Askin' for miracle 
Hopin' she's not right 
Prayin' it's the weather 
That's kept him out all night 
And the thunder rolls 
And the thunder rolls 
The thunder rolls 
And the lightnin' strikes 
Another love grows cold 
On a sleepless night 
As the storm blows on 
Out of control 
Deep in her heart 
The thunder rolls 
She's waitin' by the window 
When he pulls into the drive 
She rushes out to hold him 
Thankful he's alive 
But on the wind and rain 
A strange new perfume blows 
And the lightnin' flashes in her eyes 
And he knows that she knows 
And the thunder rolls 
And the thunder rolls 
The thunder rolls 
And the lightnin' strikes 
Another love grows cold 
On a sleepless night 
As the storm blows on 
Out of control

Clock still ticking life goes on
Radio still plays a song
As I try to put my scattered thoughts in place
And it takes all the strength I've got
To stumble to the coffee pot
The first of many lonely mornings I have to face
You called to see if I'm ok
I look out the window and I just say
Last night I prayed the Lord my soul to keep
Then I cried myself to sleep
So sure life wouldn't go on without you

"love me","collin raye","1992","Country","I read a note my grandma wrote back in nineteen twenty-three
Grandpa kept it in his coat, and he showed it once to me, he said
""Boy, you might not understand, but a long, long time ago
Grandma's daddy didn't like me none, but I loved your grandma so""
We had this crazy plan to meet and run away together
Get married in the first town we came to, and live forever
But nailed to the tree where we were supposed to meet, instead
I found this letter, and this is what it said
""If you get there before I do
Don't give up on me
I'll meet you when my chores are through
I don't know how long I'll be""
""But I'm not gonna let you down
Darling wait and see
And between now and then, until I see you again
I'll be loving you, love, me""
I read those words just hours before my grandma passed away
In the doorway of a church where me and grandpa stopped to pray
I know I'd never seen him cry in all my fifteen years
But as he said these words to her, his eyes filled up with tears
""If you get there before I do
Don't give up on me
I'll meet you when my chores are through
I don't know how long I'll be""
""But I'm not gonna let you down

The love that we once had is all I need
So take everything we have if it makes you happy
But darlin' let me say before I leave
These sticks and stones ain't all that makes a home
They don't have arms to hold you when love goes wrong
Now you say, we are through, these sticks and stones may break me

You took my hand and said we don't need much
Just as long as we're together we would be fine
Now we've acquired all I thought would please you
I gave everything you know that I could
Still you're telling me you're not satisfied

"a jukebox with a country song","doug stone","1992","Country","After three good years together we had our first big fight
So she went to her mother's and I went for a ride
Down an old familiar highway, just a few miles out of town
To that rundown one-room tavern that used to be my stomping ground
Well I pulled in the driveway, you know it all still looked the same
And I couldn't wait to down a few and hear that jukebox ring
Well as I walked into the doorway, oh there stood some kind of Matre D'
Well he looked me up and he looked me down, said
""May I help you please?"", and I said
""What'd you do with those swinging doors?
Where's the sawdust, on the floor?
Why's everybody wearing suits and ties?
From where I stand I can't believe my eyes
And who's idea was it to hang these furs?
This brand new bar don't have a single burn
I guess I'm somewhere that I don't belong
I need a jukebox with a country song""
Well I look back to the corner where the jukebox once stood proud
Some fool was playing records, too fast, too long, and too loud
And it must have been a big mistake to try to speak my mind
So as they were asking me to leave I cried out one more time
What'd you do with those swinging doors?
Where's the sawdust, on the floor?
Why's everybody wearing suits and ties?
From where I stand I can't believe my eyes
And who's idea was it to hang these furs?

What She's Doing Now
Last time I saw her it was turnin' colder
But that was years ago
Last I heard she had moved to Boulder
But where she's now I don't know
But there's somethin' 'bout this time of year
That spins my head around
Takes me back makes me wonder
What she's doin' now
'Cause what she's doin' now is tearin' me apart
Fillin' up my mind and emptyin' my heart
I can hear her call each time the cold wind blows
And I wonder if she knows...what she's doin' now
Just for laughs I dialed her old number
But no one knew her name
Hung up the phone sat there and wondered
If she'd ever done the same
I took a walk in the evenin' wind
To clear my head somehow
But tonight I lie here thinkin'
What she doin' now
'Cause what she's doin' now is tearin' me apart
Fillin' up my mind and emptying my heart
I can hear her call each time the cold wind blows
And I wonder if she knows
What she's doin' now is tearin' me apart
Fillin' up my mind and emptying my heart
I can hear her call each time the cold wind blows
And I wonder if she knows...what she's doin' now"

Tonight she's only sippin' white wine
She's friendly, and fun lovin'
Most of the time
But don't ask her on a straight tequila night
She'll start thinkin' about him, and she's ready to fight
Blames her broken heart on every man in sight
On a straight tequila night
Here's a glass of chablis, some quarters and change
Maybe you can turn her love life around
Then she won't need the salt or the lime anymore
To shoot that old memory down
Just remember her heart's on the mend
So if you ever come back to see her again
Don't ask her on a straight tequila night
She'll start thinkin' about him, and she's ready to fight

Never did dream
of ever leaving southern Arizona
Of ever hearing wedding bells ring
Never had a lot of luck with the ladies
Sure had a lot of good working skills
Never cared about climbing any ladders
He knew the way in a small cafe 
he found the will
Met Miss Bonnie and little bit of her was a little too much
Two movies and a few months later
The feeling got stronger
Didn't own a car so it must have been love
Drove him up town for diamond
That's when he started going
Over the line - Working overtime
To give her things 
just to hear her say she don't deserve 'em
But he loves when he just keeps going overboard
Over the limit to afford
To give her things he knew she wanted
'cause without her where would he be
See, it's not for him...
She is his only need
Ring on her finger and one on the ladder
New promotion every now and then
Bonnie working till she couldn't tie her apron
Then stayed at home and had the first of two children
My how the time did fly
The babies grew up and moved away
Left them sitting on the front porch rocking
Billy watching Bonnie's hair turn gray
And every once in awhile 
you could see him get up and he headed downtown
'cause he heard about something she wanted
And it would have to be found
Didn't matter how simple or how much
it was love
And boy ain't that love something
when it's strong enough to keep a man

That lonesome feeling comes to my door
And the whole world turns blue
There's a rundown bar across the railroad tracks
I've got a table for two way in back
Where I sit alone and think of losing you
I spend most every night beneath the light of a neon moon
Now if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams of a neon moon
I think of two young lovers running wild and free
I close my eyes and sometimes see
You in the shadows of this smoke-filled room
No telling how many tears I've sat here and cried
Or how many lies that I've lied
Telling my poor heart she'll come back someday
Oh, but I'll be alright as long as there's light from a neon moon
Oh if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams of a neon moon
The jukebox plays on, drink by drink
And the words of every sad song seem to say what I think
And it's heard inside of me, ain't never gonna end
Oh, but I'll be alright as long as there's light from a neon moon
Oh if you lose your one and only

Somewhere Other Than The Night
He could see the storm clouds rollin' across the hill 
He barely beat the rain in from the field 
And between the backdoor slammin' she heard him say 
""Damn this rain and damn this wasted day"" 
But she'd been waitin' for this day for oh so long 
She was standin' in the kitchen with nothin' but her apron on 
And in disbelief he stood and he stared a while 
When their eyes met, they both began to smile  
Somewhere other than the night 
She needs to hear I love you 
Somewhere other than the night 
She needs to know you care 
She wants to know she's needed 
She needs to be held tight 
Somewhere other than the night  
They spent the day wrapped up in a blanket 
On the front porch swing 
He'd come to realize he'd neglected certain things 
And there are times she feels alone even by his side 
It was the first time she ever saw him cry  
Somewhere other than the night 
She needs to hear I love you 
Somewhere other than the night 
She needs to know you care 
She wants to know she's needed 
She needs to be held tight 
Somewhere other than the night  
To know she's needed 
She needs to be held tight

"look heart no hands","randy travis","1993","Country","I remember how it used to feel
Riding down old two mile hill
Tennis shoes up on the handle bars
Paying no mind to the passing cars
No doubts, no fears, just like when you are here
No chains, no strings, no fences, no wall
No net, just you to catch me when I fall
Look heart, no hands
It took a little time to get up to speed
To find the confidence and strength I need
To just let go and reach for the sky
You know sometimes it felt I could fly
No doubts, no fears, just like when you are here
No chains, no strings, no fences, no wall
No net, just you to catch me when I fall
Look heart, no hands
It doesn't take much, just a smile or a touch
And I'm a kid again, I can almost feel that wind
No chains, no strings, no fences, no wall
No net, just you to catch me when I fall
Look heart, no hands, look heart, no hands"
"too busy being in love","doug stone","1993","Country","If I had taken the time
To write down a few lines
Every time that you crossed this heart of mine
I'd put them all in a book
How much time would that have took
The words in years have a way, you're slipping back
Oh no, too bad
There goes the chance that I had
I could have written a play so sweet and so funny
Given old Mr. Shakespeare, a run for his money
Written the words to the prettiest tune
That would never leave a dry eye in the room
My only excuse for not doing enough
Well, I was too busy, being in love
Yes, I was too busy, being in love
Brand new phrases appear
Every time you are near
All these words you inspire after all these years
But I never reached for a pen
Break the mood that I'm in
Before I knew it, the words were gone again
Oh no, too bad
There goes the chance that I had
I could have written a play so sweet and so funny
Given old Mr. Shakespeare a run for his money
Written the words to the prettiest tune
That would never leave a dry eye in the room

Well, I was too busy, being in love
Yes, I was too busy, being in love

I could have written the movie for Hepburn and Tracey
The beautiful song and it starts with your name
Written my way into fortune and fame

"can i trust you with my heart","travis tritt","1993","Country","When you meet that certain someone
You've been searchin' hard to find
It's a new love full of passion
That can sometimes make you blind
I don't mind bein' swept away
If I know right from the start
So before we go much further, girl
Can I trust you with my heart?
In the time we've spent together
I have learned to trust in you
So many things you've given
Before I even asked you to
But reality and romance
Are sometimes far apart
So what I really need to know is
Can I trust you with my heart?
Can I cast my cares upon you?
Can you stand a heavy load?
Can I count on you to walk me
Down that long and winding road?
If you promise me
These simple things
I can guaranty
You can always count on me
Can I cast my cares upon you?
Can you stand a heavy load?
Can I count on you to walk me
Down that long and winding road?
When two hearts solely surrender
And are sworn to understand
It completes a perfect union
Between a woman and a man
So please don't misunderstand me
I don't want to go too far
Without knowing just one answer
Can I trust you with my heart?
Please, girl
Give me just one answer
Can I trust you with my heart?
Please"

That Summer
I went to work for her that summer 
A teenage kid so far from home 
She was a lonely widow woman 
Hell bent to make it on her own 
We were a thousand miles from nowhere 
Wheat fields as far as I could see 
Both needing something from each other 
Not knowing yet what that might be 
'Til she came to me one evening 
Hot cup of coffee and a smile 
In a dress that I was certain 
She hadn't worn in quite a while 
There was a difference in her laughter 
There was a softness in her eyes 
And on the air there was a hunger 
Even a boy could recognize 
She had a need to feel the thunder 
To chase the lightning from the sky 
To watch a storm with all its wonder 
Raging in her lover's eyes 
She had to ride the heat of passion 
Like a comet burning bright 
Rushing headlong in the wind 
Out where only dreams have been 
Burning both ends of the night 
That summer wind was all around me 
Nothing between us but the night 
When I told her that I'd never 
She softly whispered ""That's alright"" 
And then I watched her hands of leather 
Turn to velvet in a touch 
There's never been amother summer 
When I have ever loved as much 
She had a need to feel the thunder 
To chase the lightning from the sky 
To watch a storm with all its wonder 
Raging in her lover's eyes 
She had to ride the heat of passion 
Like a comet burning bright 
Rushing headlong in the wind 
Out where only dreams have been 
Burning both ends of the night 
I often think about that summer 
The sweat, the moonlight and the lace 
And I have rarely held another 
When I haven't seen her face 
And every time I pass a wheat field 
And watch it dancing with the wind 
Although I know it isn't real 
I swear inside I feel 
Her hungry arms again 
She had a need to feel the thunder 
To chase the lightning from the sky 
To watch a storm with all its wonder 
Raging in her lover's eyes 
She had to ride the heat of passion 
Like a comet burning bright 
Rushing headlong in the wind 
Out where only dreams have been 
Burning both ends of the night 
Rushing in long in the wind 
Out where only dreams have been 
Burnin' both ends of the night"
"money in the bank","john anderson","1993","Country","It's Friday night, baby, get ready, set, go.
Gonna take you to the Krystal and a picture show.
Well, the sky's the limit, there's no price too high,
Baby, you're the apple of my eye.
Got my paycheck in my pocket and some gas in the tank:
Honey, your love's better than money in the bank.
I wish I had a bass boat and a Z-28.
But I guess that stuff'll have to wait.
'Cause I'm saving on a washer and a wedding ring,
I want this love to be a lasting thing.
Right at the top, that's where you rank:
Honey, your love's better than money in the bank.
Oh, oh, you make me feel like a million bucks.
Oh, oh, I oughta drive you around in an armored truck.
Late last night, I had a crazy dream.
I met a man who invented a money machine.
He said: ""I know things are tight and times are tough,""
But he'd give me the machine if I'd give you up.
I just looked him in the eye and I said: ""No thanks.""
Honey, your love's better than money in the bank.
Honey, your love's better than money in the bank."
"chattahoochee","alan jackson","1993","Country","Well, way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie
We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt
We got a little crazy but we never got caught.
Down by the river on a Friday night
Pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talkin' 'bout cars and dreamin' 'bout women
Never had a plan, just a livin' for the minute.
Yeah, way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love.
Ya ha
Well, we fogged up the windows in my old Chevy
I was willin' but she wasn't ready
So I settled for a burger and a grape sno-cone
I dropped her off early but I didn't go home.

I woke up dog tired, beat down, half dead
Tryin' to recover from another wild weekend
Chuggin' down coffee while I should've been sleepin'

I gotta get myself through the week somehow
I had a ball on Friday, Saturday an' Sunday
But it's all over now and it sure is Monday
Well I got to the job site at a quarter past nine
And somehow I stayed awake till lunch time
And then I caught a little nap stretched out in my truck bed
My feet still twitchin' to the music in my head

Ain't Goin' Down ('Til The Sun Comes Up)
Six o'clock on Friday evening 
Momma doesn' t know she's leaving 
'Til she hears the screen door slamming 
Rubber squealin' gears a jamming 
Local country station just a blaring on the radio 
Pick him up at seven and they're headin' to the rodeo 
Momma's on the front porch screamin' out her warning 
Girl you better get your red head 
Back in bed before the morning 
Nine o'clock the show is ending 
But the fun is just beginning 
She knows he's anticipating 
But she's gonna keep him waiting 
Grab a bite to eat 
And then they're heading to the honkey tonk 
But loud crowds and line dancing 
Just ain't what they really want 
Drive out to the boondocks and park down by the creek 
And where it's George Strait 'til real late 
And dancing cheek to cheek 
Ain't going down 'til the sun comes up 
Ain't givin' in 'til they get enough 
Going 'round the world in a pickup truck 
Ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes up 
Ten 'til twelve is wine and dancing 
Midnight starts the hard romancing 
One o'clock that truck is rocking 
Two is coming, still no stopping 
Break to check the clock at three 
They're right on where they want to be 
Four o'clock get up and going 
Five o'clock that rooster's crowing 
Ain't going down 'til the sun comes up 
Ain't givin' in 'til they get enough 
Going 'round the world in a pickup truck 
Ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes up 
Six o'clock on Saturday 
Her folks don't know he's on his way 
The stalls are clean, the horses fed 
They say she's grounded 'til she's dead 
Well here he comes around the bend 
Slowing down, she's jumping in 
Hey mom, you're daughter's gone 
And there they go again 
Ain't going down 'til the sun comes up 
Ain't givin' in 'til they get enough 
Going 'round the world in a pickup truck

Laughin' at all my best friends jokes
Things I loved when I was a kid
Muddy roads, muddy feet
I didn't live on no blacktop street

And I don't wanna think about tomorrow

I just wanna live until I die

Standin' proud, standin' tall
Standin' smack dab in the middle of it all

And I don't wanna think about tomorrow

Foolish Pride
(Travis Tritt)
She stayed up all night and cried into her pillow
And fought off the urge to just break down and call
Last night to find the fault seemed so darn easy
But now who's to blame don't matter much at all
She thinks if she calls him, it just shows weakness
So the hurt goes on with every tear she's cried
Ain't it sad to see a good love fall to pieces
Chalk another heartbreak up to foolish pride
Turn out the lights, the competition's over
The stubborn souls are the losers here tonight
And while the bridges burn
Another hard hard lesson's learned
As in the ashes, passion slowly dies
And this romance goes down to foolish pride
He relives every word they spoke in anger
He walks to floor and punches out the wall
To apologize to her, would be so simple
But instead he cries, 'I'll be damned if I crawl'
If he loses her, he's lost his best friend
And more than just a lover can provide
So he wrestles with emotions that defeat him
Chalk another love lost up to foolish pride

I heard Angels rise and praise
When I heard you whisper my name
And I heard music bring a heart of stone to tears
And I heard peace ring like an anthem through the years
And I heard hatred fall from grace
When I heard you whisper my name
Beating softly against the waves
Fell a sound of an early morning rain
And though the lighting and thunder came
I still heard you whisper my name
I heard music bring a heart of stone to tears
And I heard peace ring like an anthem through the years
And I heard hatred fall from grace

His car drives away with teenagers in it
The driver tells his buddies got one life to live

The kid guns the gas, car starts to swerve
Heads for the semi truck jumps the curb
Truck hits the big boy in Schoney's parkin' lot
Who flies through the air takes out the bank clock
Clock strikes a light pole transformer sparks
Lines go down, the town goes dark
Waitress calls the cops says, she saw it all
Swears a giant alien has landed at the mall
Cops ring up the Mayor, say there's panic in the streets
We hate to wake you up but we can't find the chief
Mayor says, use your head if he ain't in his car

I could list them one by one
She would still be gone
Her eyes are blue, her hair was long
In sixty-four she was born in Baton Rouge
Her favorite song is in my life, I memorized her every move
I knew her books, her car, her clothes
But I paid no attention to what mattered most
I'd never ask, she never said
And when she cried, I turned my head
She dreamed her dreams, behind closes doors
And that made them easy to ignore
And I know, I know, I missed the forest full of trees
And all I have to show
Oh, but she walked out the door
The cold facts and nothing more

Dust On The Bottle

Creole williams lived down a dirt road
Made homemade wine like nobody i know
Dropped by one friday night and said can you help me creole
Got a little girl waitin' on me and i wanna treat her right
I got what you need son, it's sittin down in the cellar
He reached through the cobwebs as he turned on the light and said
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But don't let it fool ya about what's inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
It's one of those things that gets sweeter with time
She was sittin in the porch swing as i pulled up the driveway
My ole heart was racing as she climbed inside
She slid over real close and drove down to the lake road
Watched the sun fade in that big red sky
I reached under the front seat and said, now here's something special
It's just been waiting for a night like tonight
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But don't let it fool ya about what's inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
It's one of those things that gets sweeter with time
You're still with me, and we've made some memories
After all these years theres one thing i've found
Some say good love, well it's like a fine wine
It keeps getting better as the days go by
There might be a little dust on the bottle

"check yes or no","george strait","1995","Country","It started way back in third grade
I used to sit beside Emmylou Hayes
A pink dress, a matching bow and her pony tail
She kissed me on the school bus, but told me not to tell
Next day I chased her 'round the playground
Across the monkey bars, to the merry-go-round
And Emmylou got caught passing me a note
Before the teacher took it, I read what she wrote
""Do you love me, do you wanna be my friend?
And if you do
Well then don't be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes, check yes or no""
Now we're grown up and she's my wife
Still like two kids with stars in our eyes
Ain't much changed, I still chase Emmylou
Up and down the hall, around the bed in our room
Last night I took her out in a white limousine
Twenty years together, she still gets to me
Can't believe it's been that long ago
When we got started with just a little note
""Do you love me, do you wanna be my friend?
And if you do
Well then don't be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes, check yes or no""

The Beaches Of Cheyenne
They packed up all his buckles 
And shipped his saddle to his dad 
By the way the house looked 
She must have took it bad 
The workers come on Monday 
To fix the door and patch the wall 
They say she just went crazy 
The night she got the call 
He was up in Wyoming 
And drew a bull no man could ride 
He promised her he'd turn out 
Well it turned out that he lied 
And all the dreams that they'd been livin' 
In the California sand 
Dyin' right there beside him in Cheyenne 
They she just went crazy 
Screamin' out his name 
She ran out into the ocean 
And to this day they claim 
That you can go down by the water 
And see her footprints in the sand 
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne 
They never found her body 
Just her diary by her bed 
It told about the fight they had 
And the words that she had said 
When he told her he was ridin' 
She said then I don't give a damn 
If you never come back from Cheyenne 
Nobody can explain it 
Some say she's still alive 
They even claim they've seen her 
On the shoreline late at night 
If you go down by the water 
You'll see her footprints in the sand

"don't get me started","rhett akins","1996","Country","Well it was January not the fourth of July
A snow white morning and a clear blue sky
We were miles from nowhere but somehow or other love found us
We were laughing and looking in each other's hearts
Talking and touching trying so hard
Not to notice what was going on all around us
But there were fireworks flashing, thunder clapping
Big waves crashing on the shore
There were church bells ringing and Angels singing
All gathered around Heaven's door
Then we kissed and I saw the light
I could go on about this all night
Hey darling, if you don't wanna hear how the waters parted
Then don't get me started
No don't get me started I'm warning you
Unless you've got an extra week or two
You know darn well how I get when you get me going
No, don't get me talking about us
About the day we fell in love
Unless you're longing for a dose of strong emotions
'Cause there were fireworks flashing, thunder clapping
Big waves crashing on the shore
There were church bells ringing and Angels singing
All gathered around Heaven's door
Then we kissed and I saw the light

Baby I'm long gone
I get carried away

Like a feather flyin' high up in the sky
On a windy day, I get carried away

Same ol' stars, the same ol' moon up high

Nothin's ordinary anymore

When the cloud is rolling over thunder striking me
It's as bright as lightning and i wonder why i couldn't see
That it's always good and when the flood is gone we still remain
Guess i've known all along i just belong here with you falling

Of the storms that will be calling

One restless summer, we found love, growing wild
On the banks of the river, on a well beaten path
It's funny how those memories they last
Like strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love, oh, bittersweet
The green on the vine like strawberry wine
I still remember when thirty was old
My biggest fear was September, when he had to go
A few cards and letters and one long distance call
We drifted away like the leaves in the fall
But year after year, I come back to this place
Just to remember the taste
Of strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love, oh, bittersweet
The green on the vine like strawberry wine
The fields have grown over now
Years since they've seen a plow
There's nothing time hasn't touched
Is it really him or the loss of my innocence
I've been missing so much? Yeah

How was I to know that I'd be okay
Thought I'd lose it all when you walked away
How was I to know I would be the strong
I had what it takes all along
How was I to know
What I was so afraid of
Turned out to be my freedom in disguise
Now I know what I'm made of
Guess it just took some time to realize
Oh, I was blind I couldn't tell
Put too much faith in someone else
I gave up on myself
How was I to know that I'd be okay
Thought I'd lose it all when you walked away
How was I to know I would be the strong
I had what it takes all along
How was I to know
How was I to know that I'd be okay

We could go through life together without a worry or a care
Knowing deep down in our hearts that we've got something special here

Was only in my head?

Take a look around and find a better man
Upright no matter how he's faring

So many people out running around
Handicapped before they hit the ground
Thinking there's nowhere to go
Shouldn't we all be looking for ways
To keep on seeing our better days
We're not chained to what we know
But if your eyes are open and your mind is free
There's no tellin' what a man can be
Upright no matter how you're faring
No matter what kind of shoes you're wearing
The shoes you're wearing
They don't make the man
But if you can't walk through the best of times and the worst of times
Find your feet still walking the line

"right on the money","alan jackson","1999","Country","Well let's begin with the day I met her
How fast this good old boy's world got better
Sky got bluer, the grass got greener
Just the first few seconds after I first seen her
Like my favorite song on a new set of speakers
My best old jeans and my broke in sneakers
A home run pitch floating right down the middle
The sweet music made when the bow hits the fiddle
She's right on the money
She goes direct to my heart
And when it comes to loving me
She's everything, I mean bulls eye perfect
She's right on the money
She's no red lights when I've overslept
She's a three point jump shot that's nothing but net
A hand full of aces, the dealer's done dealing
I'm forever on a roll, that's how she's got me feeling
She's right on the money
She goes direct to my heart
And when it comes to loving me
She's everything, I mean bulls eye perfect
She's right on the money
She's the best cook that's ever melted cheese
I ain't much around the house, but I aim to please
There's absolutely no reason to doubt her
When she says, I wouldn't last ten minutes without her
She's right on the money
She goes directly to my heart
When it comes to loving me
She's everything, I mean bulls eye perfect
She's right on the money
She goes directly to my heart
When it comes to loving me
She's everything, I mean bulls eye perfect
She's right on the money"
"wrong again","martina mcbride","1999","Country","From the day we met
You made me forget all my fears
Knew just what to say
And you kissed away all my tears
I knew this time I had finally found
Someone to build my life around
Be a lover and a friend
After all my heart had put me through
I knew that it was safe with you
And what we had would never end, wrong again
Everybody swore
They'd seen this before, we'd be fine
And you'd come to see
That you still loved me in good time
And they said, ""There's nothing you can do
It's something that he's going through
Happens to a lot of men""
And I told myself that they were right
That you'd wake up and see the light
And I just had to wait 'til then, wrong again
And it seemed to me the pain would last
My chance for happiness had passed
Nothing waited 'round the bend
I was sure I'd never find someone
To heal the damage you had done
My poor heart would never mend, wrong again, wrong again"
"stand beside me","jo dee messina","1999","Country","He left me cryin' late one Sunday night outside of Boulder
He said he had to find himself out on the road
I guess when love goes wrong
You've gotta learn to be strong
So I worked two jobs and I moved three times
I ended up south of Memphis, workin' down in Riverside
I may not be so lucky in love
But the one thing I'm sure of
I want a man that stands beside me
Not in front of or behind me
Give me two arms that want to hold me, not own me
And I'll give all the love in my heart
Stand beside me
Be true, don't tell lies to me
I'm not lookin' for a fantasy
I want a man who stands beside me
I didn't expect to see him, one hot July morning
His hair was longer but his eyes were the same old blue
He said, ""I've missed you for so long
Oh baby, what can I do?""
I said, ""I want a man that stands beside me
Not in front of or behind me
Give me two arms that want to hold me, not own me
And I'll give all the love in my heart""
Oh, it's hard to tell him, ""No""
When I want him so bad

Lonely minds or two stubborn hearts

He took my Mom out to a movie and for once I got to go
A few months later I remember lying there in bed
I overheard him pop the question and I prayed that she'd say yes
And then all of a sudden oh it seemed so strange to me
How we went from somethings missing to a family
Lookin' back all I can say about all the things he did for me
Is I hope I'm at least half the Dad that he didn't have to be
I met the girl that's now my wife about three years ago
We had the perfect marriage but we wanted somethin' more
Now here I stand surrounded by our family and friends
Crowded 'round the nursery window as they bring the baby in
And now all of a sudden oh it seemed so strange to me
How we've gone from somethings missing to a family
Lookin' through the glass I think about the man that's standin' next to me
And I hope I'm at least half the Dad that he didn't have to be
And lookin' back all I can say about all the things he did for me
Is I hope I'm at least half the Dad that he didn't have to be
Yeah, I hope I'm at least half the Dad that he didn't have to be
Because he didn't have to be, you know he didn't have to be"

"the best day","george strait","2000","Country","We loaded up my old station wagon
With a tent, a Coleman and sleepin' bags
Some fishin' poles, a cooler of Cokes
Three days before we had to be back
When you're seven, you're in Seventh Heaven
When you're goin' campin' in the wild outdoors
And as we turned off on that old dirt road
He looked at me and swore
Dad, this could be the best day of my life
I've been dreamin' day and night 'bout the fun we'll have
Just me and you doin' what I've always wanted to
I'm the luckiest boy alive
This is the best day of my life
His fifteenth birthday rolled around
Classic cars were his thing
When I pulled in the drive with that old 'Vette
I thought that boy would go insane
When you're in your teens
Your dreams revolve around four spinning wheels
We worked nights on end till it was new again
And as he sat behind the wheel, he said
Dad, this could be the best day of my life
I've been dreamin' day and night 'bout the fun we'll have
Just me and you doin' what I've always wanted to
I'm the luckiest boy alive
This is the best day of my life
Standin' in a little room
Back of the church with our tuxes on
Lookin' at him I say
""I can't believe, son, that you're grown""
He said
Dad, this could be the best day of my life
I've been dreamin' day and night of bein' like you

Open a door for me, what would it hurt
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things I need the most in my life
Now the days have grown to years of feelin' all alone
As she sits and wonders if all she's doin' is wrong
‘Cause lately she'd try anything just to turn his head
Would it make a difference if she said, if she said…
And the more that he lives the less that he tries
To show her the love that he holds inside
And the more that she gives the more that he sees

To open the door to a heart that I hurt

I Hope You Dance
Lee Ann Womack With Sons Of The Desert - I Hope You Dance  [ By John ]
=============================================================    TheMusicLover.Com
I hope you never lose your sense of wonder
You get your fill to eat
But always keep that hunger
May you never take one single breath for granted
God forbid love ever leave you empty handed
I hope you still feel small
When you stand by the ocean
Whenever one door closes, I hope one more opens
Promise me you'll give fate a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance
I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
Never settle for the path of least resistance
Living might mean taking chances
But they're worth taking
Lovin' might be a mistake
But it's worth making
Don't let some hell bent heart
Leave you bitter
When you come close to selling out
Reconsider
Give the heavens above
More than just a passing glance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance
I hope you dance
(Time is a wheel in constant motion always)
I hope you dance
(Rolling us along)
I hope you dance
(Tell me who)
I hope you dance
(Wants to look back on their youth and wonder)
(Where those years have gone)
I hope you still feel small
When you stand by the ocean
Whenever one door closes, I hope one more opens
Promise me you'll give fate a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

I hope you dance

I hope you dance

I hope you dance

For a four hundred horsepower jukebox on wheels

We always said, ""Someday, somehow
We were gonna get away, gonna blow this town""
What about now, how 'bout tonight?

Let's take that spin that never ends
That we've been talking about
What about now, why should we wait?

And be long gone 'fore the world moves on
And makes another round, what about now?

"the little girl","john michael montgomery","2000","Country","Her parents never took the young girl to church
Never spoke of His name never read her His word
Two non-believers walking lost in this world
Took their baby with them, what a sad little girl
Her daddy drank all day and mommy did drugs
Never wanted to play or give kisses and hugs
She'd watch the TV and sit there on the couch
While her mom fell asleep and her daddy went out
And the drinking and the fighting
Just got worse every night
Behind their couch she'd be hiding
Oh what a sad little life
And like it always does the bad just got worse
With every slap and every curse
Until her daddy in a drunk rage one night
Used a gun on her mom and then took his life
And some people from the city
Took the girl far away
To a new mom and a new dad
Kisses and hugs everyday
Her first day of Sunday school the teacher walked in
And a small little girl stared at a picture of Him
She said, â€½I know that Man up there on that cross
I don't know His name but I know He got offâ€
'Cause He was there in my old house
He held me close to His side
As I hid there behind our couch
The night that my parents died"

Best Of Intentions
Capo 1st
I had big plans for our future,
Said I'd give you the whole world somehow
I tried makin' good on that promise,
Thought I'd be so much further by now
Never could build you a castle,
Even though you're the queen of my heart
But I've had the best of intentions from the start
Now some people think I'm a loser,
Cause I seldom get things right
But you make me feel like a winner,
When you wrap me in your arms so tight
Please tell me you will remember,
No matter how much I do wrong
That I had the best of intentions all along
Chorus:
I'd gave you a ring, and I promised you things
I always thought we'd do
But my best-laid plans slipped right through my hands
to show my love for you.
And if you could read my heart,
then you'd know without exception
It was all with the best of_ intentions
Instrumental: 
Chorus
So here I am asking forgiveness,
and praying that you'll understand
Don't think I take you for granted,

I said, ""I put one back behind the bar, I bet it's probably yours""
And the next thing that I knew
There we were, lost in conversation
And before I handed her her purse
I said, ""You'll only get this back on one condition""
And we danced
Out there on that empty hardwood floor
The chairs up and the lights turned way down low
The music played, we held each other close
And we danced
And from that moment, there was never any doubt
I had found the one that I had always dreamed about
And then one evenin', when she stopped by after work
I pulled a diamond ring out of the pocket of my shirt
And as her eyes filled up with tears
She said, ""This is the last thing I expected""
And then she took me by the hand
And said, ""I'll only marry you on one condition""

One more sunset, maybe I'd be satisfied
But then again, I know what it would do
Leave me wishing still for one more day with you, one more day
First thing I'd do is pray for time to crawl
I'd unplug the telephone and keep the TV off
I'd hold you every second, say a million I love you's

I pulled in this country kitchen
To try their brand of barbecue
The sign said finger-lickin'
Well I paid the tab and the lady aked me
How'd you like my biscuit
I'll be honest with you ma'am
It ain't like mama fixed it

It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lotta front porch pickin'
Where I come from tryin' to make a livin'
And workin' hard to get to heaven
Where I come from
I was chasin' sun on 101
somewhere around Ventura
I lost a universal joint and I had to use my finger
This tall lady stopped and asked
If I had plans for dinner
Said no thanks ma'am, back home
we like the girls that sing soprano
Cause where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lotta front porch sittin'
Where I come from tryin' to make a livin'
And workin' hard to get to heaven
Where I come from
Well I was headed home on 65
somewhere around Kentucky
The CB rang for the bobtail rig
that's rollin' on like thunder
Well I answered him and he asked me
Aren't you from out in Tulsa
No, but you might'a seen me there
I just dropped a load of salsa
Where I come from It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lotta front porch pickin'
Where I come from tryin' to make a livin'
and workin' hard to get to heaven
Where I come from
Where I come from It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lotta back porch pickin'
Where I come from tryin' to make a livin'
Workin' hard to get to heaven

Angry All The Time
Here we are 
What is left of a husband and a wife four good kids 
Who have a way of gettin on with their lives 
I'm not old but I'm getting a whole lot older every day 
It's too late to keep from goin' crazy 
I got to get away 
The reasons that I can't stay don't have a thing to do with being in love 
And I understand that lovin a man shouldn't have to be this rough 
You ain't the only one Who feels like this world left you far behind 
I don't know why you gotta be Angry All The Time 
Our boys are strong the spittin image of you when you were young 
I hope someday they can see past what you have become 
I remember every time I said I'd never leave 
What I can't live with is memories of the way you used to be 
The reasons that I can't stay don't have a thing to do with being in love 
And I understand that lovin a man shouldn't have to be this rough 
You ain't the only one Who feels like this world left you far behind 
I don't know why you gotta be Angry All The Time 
Twenty years have came and went since I walked out of your door 
I never quite made it back to the one I was before 
And God it hurts me to think of you 
For the light in your eyes was gone sometimes 
I don't know why this old world can't leave well enough alone 
The reasons that I can't stay don't have a thing to do with being in love 
And I understand that lovin a man shouldn't have to be this rough 
You ain't the only one Who feels like this world left you far behind

"where were you when the world stopped turning","alan jackson","2001","Country","Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?

Did you shout out in anger, in fear for your neighbor
Or did you just sit down and cry?
Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
And pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out with pride for the red, white and blue

Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters?
I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell
You the difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope and love are some good things He gave us
And the greatest is love
Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?
Were you teaching a class full of innocent children
Or driving down some cold interstate?
Did you feel guilty 'cause you're a survivor
In a crowded room did you feel alone?
Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her?
Did you dust off that Bible at home?

Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watchin'
And turn on ""I Love Lucy"" reruns?

Did you stand in line and give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family

Sometimes I'm my own worst enemy

I got a life that most would love to have
But sometimes I still wake up fightin' mad
At where this road I'm heading down might lead
I guess that's just the cowboy in me
The urge to run, the restlessness
The heart of stone I sometimes get
The things I've done for foolish pride
The me that's never satisfied
The face that's in the mirror
When I don't like what I see

Come on, baby, it's over, let's face it

Give our love a chance
But I know without a doubt
We turned it inside out
And if we walked away
Would it make more sense
But it tears me up inside
Just to think we still could try
How long must we keep running on a carousel
Goin' round and round and never gettin' anywhere
On a wing and prayer

Know what I'm thinking

We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, til' the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgoten
It was just an old plywood boat
With a 75 Johnson with electric choke
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine
He'd say, ""You can't beat the way a old wood boat rides""
Just a little lake cross the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive
Just an old half ton short bed ford
My Uncle bought new in 64
Daddy got it right cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedels
Smiling like a hero who just received his medal
It was just an old hand me down ford
With 3 speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel and
I would press that clutch
And I would keep it right
He would say a little slower son
Your doing just fine
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive
I'm grown up now
3 daughters of my own
I let them drive my old jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile
And say
It was just an old worn out jeep
Rusty old floor boards
Hot on my feet
A young girl two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say
Turn it left, and steer it right
Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain
When Daddy let me drive
Daddy let me drive
Oh he let me drive
It's just an old plywood boat
With a 75 johnson

"unbroken","tim mcgraw","2002","Country","If I lived and breathed before you loved me, I don't recall
If I walked around at all, it was in bits and pieces of a jagged heart
You kissed me and every piece went back in place
Every pain got erased, you held me up to the sun light, now it feels like
No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken
And I never got lost, spent years in the dark
You're here, now my heart's unbroken
When I see your smile
Fill my soul again and I'm unbroken
If I doubted the power of love, baby, now I understand
I thank God for every day I wake up
To the soft touch of your magic hands
In this world sometimes the only thing that's real
Is the way you make me feel
Babe, the changes day and night, I swear it's like
No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken
And I never got lost, spent years in the dark
You're here, now my heart's unbroken
When I see your smile
Fill my soul again and I'm unbroken
I still see the night, I fell into your eyes
And when we made love it felt like the first time
No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken
And I never got lost, spent years in the dark
You're here, now my heart's unbroken
When I see your smile
Fill my soul again and I'm unbroken
Hey, I'm unbroken
Oh hey, I'm unbroken

Said, Don't get me wrong I'm glad you asked
But tonight's about me and an old memory.

I let her lead me out on the floor

And Ronnie with his two kids, how 'bout that wife he's got
And that one's kinda crazy, but that one is my baby

Crying all alone under the stands
Was a piccolo player in the marching band
And one name read and nobody really cared
But a pretty little girl with a bow in her hair
I cried

Have you forgotten how it felt that day?

And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell?

My blessings are in front of me, it's not about the land

And the view I love the most is my front porch looking in, yeah
I've traveled here and everywhere following my job
I've seen the paintings from the air brushed by the hand of God
The mountains and the canyons reach from sea to shining sea
But I can't wait to get back home to the one He made for me

Let me get a big 'Hell yeah' from the redneck girls like me, hell yeah
Victoria's Secret, well their stuffs real nice
Oh, but I can buy the same damn thing on a Wal-Mart shelf half price
Still look sexy, just as sexy as those models on TV
No, I don't need no designer tag to make my man want me
Well, you might think I'm trashy, a little too hardcore

When her prince pulled up - a white pickup truck
Her folks shoulda seen it comin' - it was only just a matter of time
Plenty old enough - and you can't stop love
She stuck a note on the screen door - ""sorry but I got to go""
That was all she wrote - her mama's heart was broke
That was all she wrote - so the story goes
Now her daddy's in the kitchen - starin' out the window
Scratchin' and a rackin' his brains
How could 18 years just up and walk away
Our little pony-tailed girl growed up to be a woman
Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hangin' out on the line
Now don't you wonder what the preacher's gonna preach about Sunday morn
Nothin' quite like this has happened here before
Well he must have been a looker - smooth talkin' son of a gun
For such a grounded girl - to just up and run
Course you can't fence time - and you can't stop love

I'd been out the night before with all my friends
A little worried, kinda wonderin' what I did
I said, "" Lord, please forgive me for my sins.""
My wife wanted to kill me, but she tried to save me first
""You're goin' if I have to drag your butt to church.""
I love this crazy, tragic,
Sometimes almost magic,
Awful, beautiful life
I read the hymns and kinda sorta sang along
And made it through the Sunday sermon wide awake
We met the family for dinner at our home
Drank some beer, watched a game, and cooked some steaks
My little brother had a big fight with his wife
And my poor mother sat between'em both all night
I love this crazy, tragic,
Sometimes almost magic,
Awful, beautiful life
We said a prayer for Cousin Michael in Iraq
We're all aware that he may never make it back
We talked about the way we missed his stupid jokes
And how he loved to be a soldier more than most

And how my life is like a roller coaster ride

Sometimes almost magic,
Awful, beautiful life

"mud on the tires","brad paisley","2005","Country","Well I've got some big news, the bank finally came through
And I'm holding the keys to the brand new Chevrolet
Have you been outside? It sure is a nice night
How â€~bout a little test-drive, down by the lake?
There's a place I know about, where the dirt road runs out
We can try out the four-wheel drive
Come on now what you say? Girl I can hardly wait
To get a little mud on the tires
'Cause it's a good night to be out there soakin' up the moonlight
Stake out a little piece of shoreline and I've got the perfect place in mind
It's in the middle of nowhere only one way to get there
You gotta get a little mud on the tires
Moonlight on a duck blind, catfish on a trot line
Sun sets about nine, this time of year
Oh we can throw a blanket down, crickets singing in the background
And more stars than you can count on a night this clear
I tell ya what we need to do is grab a sleepin' bag or two
And build us a little campfire
And then with a little luck and we might just get stuck
Lets get a little mud on the tires

"bless the broken road","rascal flatts","2005","Country","I set out on a narrow way, many years ago
Hoping I would find true love along the broken road

Every long lost dream led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart, they were like northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you
Yes He did
I think about the years I spent, just passing through
I'd like to have the time I lost, and give it back to you
But you just smile and take my hand
You've been there, you understand
It's all part of a grander plan that is coming true

"that's what i love about sunday","craig morgan","2005","Country","Raymond's in his Sunday best,
He's usually up to his chest in oil an' grease.
There's the Martin's walkin' in,
With that mean little freckle-faced kid,
Who broke a window last week.
Sweet Miss Betty likes to sing off key in the pew behind me.
That's what I love about Sunday:
Sing along as the choir sways;
Every verse of Amazin' Grace,
An' then we shake the Preacher's hand.
Go home, into your blue jeans;
Have some chicken an' some baked beans.
Pick a back yard football team,
Not do much of anything:
That's what I love about Sunday.
I stroll to the end of the drive,
Pick up the Sunday Times, grab my coffee cup.
It looks like Sally an' Ron, finally tied the knot,
Well, it's about time.
It's 35 cents off a ground round,
Baby, cut that coupon out!
That's what I love about Sunday:
Cat-napping on the porch swing;
You curled up next to me,
The smell of jasmine wakes us up.
Take a walk down a back road,
Tackle box and a cane pole;
Carve our names in that white oak,
An' steal a kiss as the sun fades,
That's what I love about Sunday,
Oh, yeah.
Ooh, new believers gettin' baptized,
Momma's hands raised up high,
Havin' a Hallelujah good time
A smile on everybody's face.
That's what I love about Sunday,
Oh, yeah.
That's what I love about Sunday,
Oh, yeah."

Me and Mary making our way into the night

The pinball bells, and the skee-ball slides
Watching the summer sun fall out of sight.
There's a warm wind coming in from off of the ocean
Making it's way past the hotel walls to fill the street
Mary is holding both of her shoes in her hand
Said she likes to feel the sand beneath her feet.
And in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
And I don't see how you could ever be
Anything but mine.
There's a local band playing at the seaside pavillion
And I've got just enough cash to get us in
And as we are dancing, Mary's wrapping her arms around me
And I can feel the sting of summer on my skin.
In the midst of the music I tell her I love her
And we both laugh, ;cause we know it isn't true
Ah, but Mary, there's a summer drawing to an end tonight
And there's so much that I long to do to you.

"something to be proud of","montgomery gentry","2005","Country","There's a story that my daddy tells religiously
Like clockwork everytime he see's an opening
In a conversation 'bout the way things use to be
I just roll my eyes and make a B-line for the door
I'd always end up starry eyes and cross legged on the floor
Hangin onto every word, man the things I heard
It was harder times and longer days
Five miles to school uphill both ways
We were cane switched raised and dirt floor poor
Course that was back before the war
Yeah your uncle and I made quit a pair
Flyin F-15's through hostile air
He went down but they missed me by a hair
He'd always stop right there and say
That's something to be proud of
That's a life you can hang your hat on
As your chins held high as the tears fall down
Gut sucked in, chest stuck out
Like a small town flag a flyin'
Or a new born baby cryin'
In the arms of the woman that you love
That's something to be proud of
Son graduatin' college, that was mommas dream
And I was on my way to anywhere else when I turned eighteen
That's when I got a fast car and think you got everything
I learned real quick those GTO's don't run on faith
I ended up broke down in some town north of L.A
Working maximum hours for minimum wage
I fell in love next thing I know
Babies came and the car got sold
Sure do miss that old hot rod
But you sure save gas in them foreign jobs
Dad I wonder if I ever let you down
If you're ashamed how I turned out
Well he lowered his voice, then he raised his brow
Said, ""Let me tell you right now""
That's something to be proud of
That's a life you can hang your hat on
No need to make a million just be thankful to be workin'
If you're doin' what you're able
Puttin' food there on the table
And providing for the family that you love
That's something to be proud of
And before you ever really do is the best you can
Well you did it man
That's something to be proud of
That's a life you can hang your hat on
As your chin held high as the tears fall down
Gut sucked in, chest stuck out
Like a small town flag a flyin'
Or a new born baby cryin'
In the arms of the woman that you love

"she let herself go","george strait","2006","Country","He wondered how she'd take it when he said goodbye
Thought she might do some cryin', lose some sleep at night
But he had no idea when he hit the road
That without him in her life she'd let herself go
Let herself go on a single's cruise to Vegas once, then to Honolulu
Let herself go to New York City
A week at the spa, came back knocked out pretty
When he said he didn't love her no more, she let herself go
She poured her heart and soul into their three bedroom ranch
Spent her days raisin' babies, ironin' his pants
Came home one day from the grocery store and found his note
And without him there to stop her she let herself go
Let herself go on her first blind date
Had the time of her life with some friends at the lake
Let herself go buy a brand new car
Drove down to the beach he always said was too far
Sand sure felt good between her toes
She let herself go on a singles cruise to Vegas once, then to Honolulu
Let herself go to New York City
A week at the spa came back knocked out pretty
When he said he didn't love her no more, she let herself go

"jesus take the wheel","carrie underwood","2006","Country","She was driving last Friday on her way to Cincinnati
On a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go, she was running low on faith in gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was going way to fast
Before she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was sooo scared
She threw her hands up in the air
Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this all on my own
Imma let it go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Jesus take the wheel
It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight
Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
Imma let it go
So give me one more chance
To save me from this road I'm on
Oh, Jesus take the wheel
Oh, I'm letting go...
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
From this road I'm on

Oh, take it, take it from me

flew out to LA for the weekend,

talkin' mooshy-mooshy bout nothin'.

yano i feel just like a kid again.
i got a brand new girlfriend.

i love it when she calls me butter cup,
laughs and says i left the toilet seat up,
she pops and tosses me a cold beer,
and says my buddies always welcome here.
when i get hungry, she takes me out.
i ride the shotgun like a shitzu hound.
my tails a waggin', my tounges hangin' out,
it makes me wanna shout...

I bowed my head and I prayed real hard
Said lord please help me help my stupid self

Turning on my son's scooby doo nightlight
He crawled out of bed and he got down on his knees

"never wanted nothing more","kenny chesney","2007","Country","I couldn't wait to turn sixteen
And drive all the boys around
Foot on the gas and hands on the wheel
Was all I could think about
A little rust in the bed of that truck
And a four speed on the floor
Five hundred dollars it was mine, all mine
And I never wanted nothing more
I took Katie down by the river
With a six dollar bottle of wine
Just a fool tryin' to play it cool
Hopin' she'd let me cross the line
And I was prayin' that she couldn't tell
I'd never been that far before
The first time's a one time feeling
And I never wanted nothin' more
Naw I never wanted nothin' more
Well, I'm what I am and I'm what I'm not
And I'm sure happy with what I've got
I live to love and laugh a lot
And that's all I need
My buddies all tried to change my mind
But I told them that I thought it through
Well, Katie laughed and my momma cried
When they heard me say, â€½I doâ€
Her little ring was a little thing
But it was all that I could afford
Now she's mine all mine till the day I die
And I never wanted nothing more
Naw I never wanted nothing more
Well, I'm what I am and I'm what I'm not

One Sunday I listened to the preacher
And I knew he was preaching to me
I couldn't help it, I walked up front
And I got down on my knees
Right then and there I swear
I changed when I found the Lord
Glory Hallelujah, Good God Almighty

You should see your kids and wife

These are nowhere near the best years of your life
I guess I'll see you in the mirror when you're a grown man

Finally death came callin'
For this small town Southern man
He said it's alright 'cause I see angels
And they got me by the hand
Don't you cry, and don't you worry
I'm blessed, and I know I am
'Cause God has a place in Heaven
For a small town Southern man
And he bowed his head to Jesus
And he stood for Uncle Sam
And he only loved one woman

He said his greatest contribution
Is the ones you leave behind

"i saw god today","george strait","2008","Country","Just walked down the street to the coffee shop
Had to take a break
I'd been by her side for eighteen hours straight
Saw a flower growin' in the middle of the sidewalk
Pushin' up through the concrete
Like it was planted right there for me to see
The flashin' lights, the honkin' horns
All seemed to fade away
In the shadow of that hospital at 5:08
I saw God today
I've been to church, I've read the Book
I know He's here, but I don't look
Near as often as I should
Yea, I know I should
His fingerprints are everywhere
I just slowed down to stop and stare
Opened my eyes, and man, I swear
I saw God today
Saw a couple walking by, they were holding hands
Man she had that glow
Yea, I couldn't help but notice she was starting to show
Stood there for a minute taking in the sky
Lost in that sunset
A splash of amber melted into shades of red
I've been to church, I've read the Book
I know He's here, but I don't look
Near as often as I should
Yea, I know I should
His fingerprints are everywhere
I just slowed down to stop and stare
Opened my eyes, and man, I swear
I saw God today
Got my face pressed up against the nursery glass
She's sleeping like a rock
My name on her wrist, wearing tiny pink socks
She's got my nose, she's got her mama's eyes
My brand new baby girl
She's a miracle
I saw God today"

Well, love makes a man do some things he ain't proud of
And in a weak moment I might
Walk your sissie dog, hold your purse at the mall

"back when i knew it all","montgomery gentry","2008","Country","At the ripe old age of nineteen
I bought a short-bed pick-up-chicks machine
Life ran on beer and gasoline
A half a lap ahead of the law
I had a fake ID that got me into Tuffies
Love was a word I used to get lucky
Was a big time spender with that plastic money
Back when I knew it all
Back when the world was flat
And mama and daddy didn't have a clue, that was back
Back when a pitcher of beer and a couple shots
Made me bulletproof
Back when God was a name I used in vain
To get a point across when I got ticked off
Lord I'm learning so much more
Than back when I knew it all
I found out credit cards don't mean you're rich
And beer and gasoline don't mix
Yeah, step side trucks can't jump a ditch
And those big house rooms sure are small
I've learned that love is a woman that will settle you down
A Sunday sermon can turn life around
Man I can't believe all the actors I've found
Since back when I knew it all
Back when the world was flat
And mama and daddy didn't have a clue, that was back

Sixpence in a shoe, something borrowed, something blue
And when the church doors opened up wide
She put her veil down
Trying to hide the tears
Oh, she just couldn't believe it
She heard the trumpets from the military band
And the flowers fell out of her hands
Baby why'd you leave me
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, ""He's not coming home now.""
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream
The preacher man said, ""Let us bow our heads and pray.
Lord please lift his soul, and heal this hurt.""
Then the congregation all stood up and sang the saddest song that she ever heard
Then they handed her a folded up flag
And she held on to all she had left of him
Oh, and what could have been
And then the guns rang one last shot
And it felt like a bullet in her heart
Baby, why'd you leave me
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, ""He's not coming home now.""
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream
Oh
Baby, why'd you leave me
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
Oh, I'll never know

"love story","taylor swift","2008","Country","We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes & the flashback starts
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say ""Hello"", little did I know...
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you ""Please don't go"", & I said...
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run
You'll be the prince & I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby, just say ""Yes""
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes, escape this town for a little while
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you ""Please don't go"", & I said...
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run
You'll be the prince & I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby, just say ""Yes""
Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby, just say ""Yes""
...
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said...
Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground & pulled out a ring & said
Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you & that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby, just say ""Yes""
Oh oh oh

Cold beer on a Friday night

And that's home you know
Sweet tea pecan pie and homemade wine
Where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground
And a little bit of chicken fried

A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love
Well its funny how it's the little things in life that mean the most
Not where you live or the car you drive or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a piece of mind this I've come to know
So if you agree have a drink with me
Raise you glasses for a toast
To a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love
I thank god for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly, let it ring.
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives so we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love
Like our chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child

But the best advice that I ever got
Was from my sister's rock star boyfriend
Just get you a guitar and learn how to play
Cut up some jeans, come up with a name
When you're living in a world that you don't understand
Find a few good buddies, start a band
Start a band, start a band
And all those girls that were too cool to talk to,
They'll be waiting in the line out back
Might get your picture in the hometown paper
Maybe buy your momma that Cadillac
Just get you a guitar and learn how to play
Cut up some jeans, come up with a name
When you're living in a world that you don't understand
Find a few good buddies, start a band
Start a band, scrape up some money, buy a van
Learn 'Free Bird' and 'Ramblin' Man'
Never buy another beer again
So get you a guitar and learn how to play
Grow out your hair, come up with a name
With a little bit of luck you'll be packing the stands
Find a few good buddies, start a band
No need to study, start a band
Call up some buddies man, and start a band"

Yesterday is a memory, and the pain is closing in, you can't hide, the way you really feel, so it's another ride on the marry go round of life, and a life that's empty, without you in it...
So HERE COMES GOODBYE...

You spread your wings, and now it's time to fly.
Your moving to the deep blue sky,

Yeah, we went went out last night

There were two karaoke girls drunk on a dare
Singing ""I Got You Babe"" by Sonny and Cher
Yeah, life was good everywhere
We went out last night

I grew up in east Tennessee
Well last night I was everything

I was a doctor, a lawyer, a senator's son
Brad Pitt's brother and a man on the run
Anything I thought would get the job done
Yeah, we went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Hitting on everybody and their mother
There were people doing body shots up on the bar
Jimmy in a fist fight out by the car
Everybody was some kind of star
When we went out last night
Well the fact that I'm still breathing
Means that I must have survived
And that I lived to go out with my friends again tonight
Oh, we went out last night

Everybody started loving on each other
They were dancing on the tables and howling at the moon
Pairing up together and pretty soon
There was not a soul in sight

So baby, why don't we just dance?
Guess the little bitty living room ain't gonna look like much
When the lights go down and we move the couch
It's gonna be more than enough
For my two left feet and our two hearts beatin'
Nobody's gonna see us go crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?
Down the hall, maybe straight up the stairs
Bouncin' off the wall, floatin' on air
Baby, why don't we just dance?
Baby, why don't you go put your best dress on?
Those high heeled shoes you love to lose
As soon as the tunes come on
On second thought, just the way you are
Is already drivin' me crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?
Down the hall, maybe straight up the stairs
Bouncin' off the wall, floatin' on air
Baby, why don't we just dance?
I'll cut a rug
Well it might be me but the way I see it

Oh baby, why don't we just dance?"
"that's how country boys roll","billy currington","2010","Country","Verse 1
They wake up in the morning and they drink their coffee black
They love their woman one beat shy of a heart attack
On the way to work they might stop by a fishin' hole
That's how country boys roll
Yeah, they work, work, work, all week til the job gets done
Weekends they bar-b-que and have a cold one
They run on a big ol' heart and a pinch of Skoal
That's how country boys roll
Chorous
Yeah, they're spinnin' their wheels
Castin' their reels
Way back on them ol' county roads
Singin' in bars
Soupin their cars just to see how fast they'll go
From a ball and glove to them fallin' in love
They do everything heart and soul
That's how country boys roll
Verse 2
Well if you don't know your way around
They'll draw you a map
And if you're broke and you ask
They'll give you the shirt off their back
All they need is a little gas
A few dollars to fold

"a little more country than that","easton corbin","2010","Country","Imagine a dirt road full of pot holes

Laying out front of the court house
While the old men chew the fat
I'm a little more country than that
I just want to make sure you know
Just who you're getting under this old hat
'Cause girl I'm not the kind to two time or play games
Behind your back, I'm a little more country than that
Think of a Hank song from days gone
With a steel ride that's so strong
It sends chills up your back
I'm a little more country than that
If you want a brick home in a school zone
With the doors locked and alarms on
Girl, you're way off track

Just who you're getting under this old hat
'Cause girl I'm not the kind to two time or play games
Behind your back, I'm a little more country
Yeah, I'm sure that you've heard those three words
From others, but they fell flat

the day would not be wasted on this drive.

The day might come you'll realize
That if you see thru my eyes
There was no other way to work it out
And a part of you might hate me

Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar

This brokenness inside me might start healing

Won't take nothing but a memory

From 'Better Homes and Garden' magazines
Plans were drawn and concrete poured
And nail by nail and board by board

And when that summer sun starts to beatin' down
And you don't know what to do
Grab your swimming trunks, ice up that old Igloo
And drive until the map turns blue
Daytona Beach on spring break
Eighteen girls up on stage
White t-shirts about to be sprayed with water
Let her go boys
And when that summer sun starts to beatin' down
And you don't know what to do
Just go and grab someone you wanna see in a bathing suit
And drive until the map turns blue
You can stay right there when the daylight's gone
Play truth or dare, and it won't take long
'Fore you and her got nothin' on but water
All you really need this time of year
Is a pair of shades and ice cold beer
And a place to sit somewhere near water"

It's calling in the air, ""Alrighty, yes sir, we want the ball""
And it's knockin' heads and talkin' trash, it's slinging mud and dirt and grass
It's I got your number, I got your back when your back's against the wall
You mess with one man, you got us all
The boys of fall

Nice little breeze gonna blow
Baby, I'm on my way to come and get you
Meet me at the end of your drive
Grab your shades and your string bikini
And your Coppertone 45
Bring on the sunshine, bring on the good time
Girl, let me look at you
Jump in the front seat, kick up your bare feet
Honey, let your hair down too
I know a spot down on the river
Underneath a sycamore tree
Save all your kisses up, bring on your sweet love
Pour it all over me, all over me
We can build us a fire when we run outta daylight
Let it light up your face
Lay on a blanket, listen to the river
Get a little carried away
Well, I can taste that kiss on your sweet lips
Ain't gonna want it to end
So when the morning comes we'll roll on out
And do it all over again
Bring on the sunshine, bring on the good time
Girl, let me look at you
Jump in the front seat, kick up your bare feet
Honey, let your hair down too
I know a spot down on the river
Underneath a sycamore tree
Save all your kisses up, bring on your sweet love
Pour it all over me, all over me
Bring on the sunshine, bring on the good time
Girl, just look at you
Jump in the front seat, kick up your bare feet
Honey, let your hair down too
I know a spot down on the river

"roll with it","easton corbin","2010","Country","I got my old guitar and some fishin' poles

Don't ask, just pack and we'll hit the road runnin'
Honey, what do you say?
I got just enough money and just enough gas
So pick a place on the map we can get to fast
Where the white, sandy beach meets water like glass
And if the tide carries us away
Baby, we'll roll with it
Won't think about it too much
Baby, let's just go with it
And get out of this ordinary everyday rut
And we get swept away by one of those perfect days
When the sun is sinkin' low at dusk
And wind up a little deeper in love
Baby, let's roll with it
We get so caught up in catchin' up
Tryin' to pay the rent, tryin' to make a buck
That don't leave much time for time for us
And ain't life too short for that?
So open up that bag of pig skins you bought
At the Exxon station the last time we stopped
And you kick back, baby, and dance in your socks
On the windshield to some radio rock
And we'll roll with it
Won't think about it too much
Baby, let's just go with it
And get out of this ordinary everyday rut
And we get swept away by one of those perfect days
When the sun is sinkin' low at dusk
And wind up a little deeper in love
Baby, we'll roll with it
Won't think about it too much
Sometimes you gotta go with it
Get out of this ordinary everyday rut
And it won't be no thing if it starts to rain
And we have to wait it out in the truck
Might wind up a little deeper in love
So, baby let's roll with it
Baby, let's roll with it
Baby, we'll roll with it
Baby, we'll roll with it"

I started wondering who he was going to be
And I thought heaven help us if he's anything like me
He'll probably climb a tree too tall and ride his bike too fast
End up every summer wearin' something in a cast
He's gonna throw a ball and break some glass in a window down the street
He's gonna get in trouble, oh he's gonna get in fights
I'm gonna lose my temper and some sleep
It's safe to say that I'm gonna get my payback if he's anything like me
I can see him right now, knees all skinned up
With a magnifying glass tryin' to melt the Tonka truck
Won't he be a sight with his football helmet on?
That'll be his first love 'til his first love comes along
He'll get his heart broke by the time he's in his teens
And heaven help him if he's anything like me
He'll probably stay out too late and drive his car too fast
Get a speeding ticket, he'll pay for mowing grass
He's gonna get caught skippin' class and be grounded for a week
He's gonna get into trouble, we're gonna get in fights
I'm gonna lose my temper and some sleep
It's safe to say that I'm gonna get my payback if he's anything like me
He's gonna love me and hate me along the way
Years are gonna fly by and I already dread the day
He's gonna hug his momma, he's gonna shake my hand
He's gonna act like he can't wait to leave
But as he drives out he'll cry his eyes out if he's anything like me

I've never known the loving of a man
But it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts, oh no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I been singing
Funny, when you're dead how people start listening
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
The ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket

"felt good on my lips","tim mcgraw","2011","Country","Said her name was a hand me down name
From the side of a family that long ago came
Over here on a boat from somewhere in Spain
Sounded to me just a little bit strange, I guess.
But I have to admit, it felt good on my lips.
She tipped the DJ to play her favorite song
A Spanish little number that was a rockin' on strong
She grabbed me by the sleeve and said lets go and get it on
By the second chorus I was singing right along with it
I don't know what it meant but it felt good on my lips.
Oh oh oh I. I wanna go crazy
You can go crazy too
Oh oh oh I. I wanna go crazy
I wanna go crazy with you
Everybody sayin' whoa how sweet it is
Whoa yeah it felt good on my lips
She ordered us a drink
It was a purple kind of pink
She said it's got a shot of a little bit of everything
Mello yellow umbrella for a fella like me
It was just a bit mello for me to be seen with
But I took a sip
Yeah it felt good on my lips
Oh oh oh I. I wanna go crazy
You can go crazy too
Oh oh oh I. I wanna go crazy
I wanna go crazy with you
Everybody sayin' whoa how sweet it is

I was busy getting lost in her cherry lip gloss
In a little corner booth I don't like no talk
She leaned in close and gave me one long and wet
A goodnight goodbye kiss

Talkin' 'bout everything under the moon
With the smell of honeysuckle and your perfume
All I could think about was my next move
Oh, but you were so shy, so was I
Maybe that's why it was so hard to believe
When you smiled and said to me
""Are you gonna kiss me or not?
Are we gonna do this or what?
I think you know I like you a lot
But you're 'bout to miss your shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not?""
It was the best dang kiss that I ever had
Except for that long one after that
And I knew if I wanted this thing to last
Sooner or later I'd have to ask for your hand
So I took a chance
Bought a wedding band and I got down on one knee
And you smiled and said to me
""Are you gonna kiss me or not?
Are we gonna do this or what?
I think you know I love you a lot
I think we've got a real good shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not?""
So, we planned it all out for the middle of June
From the wedding cake to the honeymoon
And your momma cried
When you walked down the aisle
When the preacher man said, ""Say I do""
I did and you did too, then I lifted that veil
And saw your pretty smile and I said
""Are you gonna kiss me or not?
Are we gonna do this or what?
Look at all the love that we got
It ain't never gonna stop
Are you gonna kiss me or not?""
Yeah baby, I love you a lot
I really think we've got a shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not?"

Take some time, waste it on number one
Find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop
Live a little, love a lot
Friday night, here we go, do a little do-si-do
Kick back, have a laugh, catch my breath
Tell the band slow it down, there she is, think I found
Maybe Ms. Wonderful, I haven't met yet
It just hit me like a wrecking ball
She's giving me a wake up call
I need to live a little, have some fun
Take some time, waste it on number one
Find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop
Live a little, love a lot
Step back, smell the rose
Feel the sand between your toes
Unplug, unwind
Step out in the sunshine
I need to live a little, have some fun
Take some time, waste it on number one
Find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop
Live a little
I need to live a little, have some fun
Take some time, waste it on number one
Take the girl, get a map and pick any old dot
Live a little, we need to live a little, love a lot"
"a little bit stronger","sara evans","2011","Country","Woke up late today and. I still feel the sting of the pain
But I brushed my teeth anyway
I got dressed through the mess and put a smile on my face
I got a little bit stronger
Riding in the car to work and I'm trying to ignore the hurt
So I turned on the radio, stupid song made me think of you
I listened to it for minute but then I changed it
I'm getting a little bit stronger, just a little bit stronger
And I'm done hoping that we could work it out
I'm done with how it feels, spinning my wheels
Letting you drag my heart around, and oh
I'm done thinking that you could ever change
I know my heart will never be the same
But I'm telling myself I'll be okay
Even on my weakest days
I get a little bit stronger
It doesn't happen overnight but you turn around
And a month's gone by and you realize you haven't cried
I'm not giving you a hour or a second or another minute longer
I'm busy getting stronger
And I'm done hoping that we can work it out
I'm done with how it feels, spinning my wheels
Letting you drag my heart around, and oh
I'm done thinking, that you could ever change
I know my heart will never be the same
But I'm telling myself I'll be okay
Even on my weakest days, I get a little bit stronger
I get a little bit stronger
Getting along without you, baby
I'm better off without you, baby
How does it feel without me, baby?
I'm getting stronger without you, baby
And I'm done hoping we could work it out
I'm done with how it feels, spinning my wheels
Letting you drag my heart around, and oh
And I'm done thinking that you could ever change
I know my heart will never be the same

"heart like mine","miranda lambert","2011","Country","I ain't the kind you take home to mama
I ain't the kind to wear no ring
Somehow I always get stronger
When I'm on my second drink
Even though I hate to admit it
Sometimes I smoke cigarettes
Christian folks say I should quit it
I just smile and say, ""God bless""
'Cause I heard Jesus, He drank wine
I bet we'd get along just fine
He could calm a storm and heal the blind
And I bet He'd understand a heart like mine
Daddy cried when he saw my tattoo
Said, he loved me anyway
My brother got the brains of the family
So I thought I'd learn to sing
'Cause I heard Jesus, He drank wine
And I bet we'd get along just fine
He could calm a storm and heal the blind
And I bet He'd understand a heart like mine
I'll fly away from it all one day
I'll fly away
These are the days that I will remember
When my names called on a roll
They'll meet me with two long stem glasses
Make a toast to me coming home
'Cause I heard Jesus, He drank wine
And I bet we'd get along just fine
He could calm a storm and heal the blind
And I bet He'd understand
Understand a heart like mine, oh yes, He would"

What would I do without you
Hearts never know the way they want to go and want to stay
We need two but in time you find the road
And though inside you know you've gotta go
The hardest part I find is you're all I ever knew
But what will I do without you
What will I do without you
I gotta break these habit chains I put on me
And be all that I can be, try and find what I need
Memories suspend in time, all the days when you were mine
And the chance I took to move, one I thought I'd never do

A hundred yards from the spot where me and grandpa
fished
There's a piece of his old fruit stand on the side of
Sawmill Road
He'd be there peelin' peaches if it was twenty years ago
And what I wouldn't give
To ride around in that old truck with him
If heaven wasn't so far away
I'd pack up the kids and go for the day
Introduce them to their grandpa
Watch 'em laugh at the way he talks
I'd find my long lost cousin John
The one we left back in Vietnam
Show him a picture of his daughter now
She's a doctor and he'd be proud
Then tell him we'd be back in a couple of days
In the rear view mirror we'd all watch 'em wave
Yeah, and losing them wouldn't be so hard to take
If heaven wasn't so far away
I'd hug all three of those girls we lost from the class of '99
And I'd find my bird dog Bo 
and take him huntin' one more time
I'd ask Hank why he took those pills back in '53
And Janis to sing the second verse of ""Me and Bobby McGee""
Sit on a cloud and visit for a while

Sittin', turning off the real life

Back in the day, pop bomb was the place to go
Load the truck up hit the dirt road
Jump the barbwire spread the word
Light the bonfire then call the girls
The king in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack and gin were a few good friends
When we learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue
And all this small town he said, she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread?

Down to my hood and back in them woods
We do it different 'round here, that's right
And we sure do it good and we do it all night
So if you really wanna know how it feels
To get off the road hwit a truck and four wheels
Jump on in, tell your friends

God gave me you for the days of doubt
God gave me you for the ups and downs

There are no words here left to say, it's true

Mmmhmmm
I grew up south of the Mason Dixon
Workin' spittin' huntin' and fishin'
Stone cold country by the grace of God
I was gasin' up the other day
An ol' boy pulled up with a license plate from Ohio I thought oh good Lord he's lost
From his wranglers to his boots
He reminded me of Chris LeDoux
And that Copenhagen smile
Country must be country wide
In every state
There's a station
Playin' Cash, Hank, Willie, and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives
There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide
And it ain't where, it's how you live
We weren't raised to take, we were raised to give
The shirt off our back, to anyone in need
We bow our heads before we eat
Before we start our day
Before we fall asleep
'Cause in God we trust and we believe
Yeah we see what's wrong
And we know what's right
And ol' Hank he said it all
When he said country folks can survive
In every state
There's a station
Playin' Cash, Hank, Willie, and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives
There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide (yeah)

Someone so much it hurts?
Your lips keep trying to speak
But you just can't find the words
Well I had this dream once
I held it in my hands
She was the purest beauty
But not the common kind
She had a way about her
That made you feel alive
And for a moment
You made the world stand still
Yeah, we owned the night
You had me dim the lights
You danced just like a child
The wine spilled on your dress
And all you did was smile
Yeah, it was perfect
I hold it in my mind
Yeah, we owned the night
When the summer rolls around
And the sun starts sinking down
I still remember you
Oh, I remember you
And I wonder where you are
Are you looking at those same stars again?
Do you remember when?
We woke under a blanket
All tangled up in skin
Not knowing in that moment
We'd never speak again
But it was perfect
I never will forget
When we owned the night
Yeah, we owned the night"

When it comes.

Ain't no good for me.
Cause you'll have to leave.
Gonna make the most of every mile.
Do anything to make your smile,
Land on my lips.
And get drunk on your kiss.

Man it all looks the same, 
Miles and miles of back roads and highways, 
Connecting little towns with funny names, 
Who'd want to live down there in the middle of nowhere, 
They've never drove through Indiana, 
Met the men who plowed that earth, 
Planted that seed, busted his ass for you and me, 
Or caught a harvest moon in Kansas, 
They'd understand why God made those fly over states, 
I bet that mile long Santa Fe freight train engineer's seen it all
Just like that flatbed cowboy stacking US steel on a 3-day haul
Road and rails under their feet
Yeah that sounds like a first class seat
On the plains of Oklahoma 
With a windshield sunset in your eyes
Like a watercolor painted sky
You'd think heavens doors have opened
You'll understand why God made 
Those fly over states
Take a ride across the badlands
Feel that freedom on your face
Breathe in all that open space
Meet a girl from Amarillo
You'll understand why God made 
Might even wanna plant your stakes
In those fly over states
Have you ever been through Indiana
On the plains of Oklahoma

There's somethin' 'bout a truck in a farmers field

After a long hard day, makes it taste just right
On that drop tailgate, on a summer night
There's somethin' 'bout a beer, sittin' on ice

The most natural thing you've ever felt before

And there's somethin' 'bout a truck in a field

Begging for another kiss
And there's somethin' 'bout you and me and the birds and the bees
And Lord have mercy it's a beautiful thing
Ain't nothin' 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck
Somethin' 'bout a creek, around 2 a.m.
After a few of those beers, you wanna dive on in
You don't need no clothes, so just hang 'em on a limb
There's somethin' 'bout a creek around 2 a.m.

You looked at me and I was done
Well, we're just getting started
I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and sang Oh-h-h-h-h-h
Stayed there 'til they forced us out
Took the long way to your house
I canstill hear the sound of you saying don't go
When I think about you, I think about 17
I think about my old jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen.
I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I, whispered your name
I bet there'd still be a spark
Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your momma'd think
About your name on my arm
Baby is it spring or is it summer
The guitar sounds or the beat of the drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio
Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear Born in the USA
You relive those glory days
So long ago
When you think about me, do you think about 17
Do you think about my old jeep
Think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody, sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night

Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
When that summer sun fell to its knees
I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night
'Cause it felt so right, her and I, man we felt so right
I put it in park and
Grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin'
Hell I can't get you out of my head
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell lot better with you up in it
Come on
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Come on girl
Get those windows down and cruise
Aww yeah"
"we are never ever getting back together","taylor swift","2013","Country","I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough"" 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space (What?)
Then you come around again and say, ""Baby
I miss you, and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you"" We break up, you call me, ""I love you""
Ooh, we called it off again last night, but ooh
This time I'm telling you, I'm telling you
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
Like, ever
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights and me
Falling for it screaming that I'm right and you
Would hide away and find your peace of mind with some
Indie record that's much cooler than mine
Ooh, you called me up again tonight, but ooh
This time I'm telling you, I'm telling you
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
I used to think that we were forever ever
And I used to say, ""Never say never""
Uh, so he calls me up and he's like, ""I still love you""
I'm like, ""I just, I mean this is exhausting
You know, like we are never getting back together""
""Like, ever"" (No!)
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
We – getting back together
We – getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together"
"better dig two","the band perry","2013","Country","I told you on the day we wed
I was gonna love you 'til I's dead
Made you wait 'til our wedding night
That's the first and the last time I wear white
So if the ties that bind ever do come loose
Tie them in a knot like a hangman's noose
Cause I'll go to heaven or I'll go to hell
Before I'll see you with someone else
Put me in the ground
Put me six foot down
And let the stone say
Here lies the girl whose only crutch
Was loving one man just a little too much
If you go before I do
I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two
Well, it won't be whiskey, won't be meth
It'll be your name on my last breath
If divorce or death ever do us part
The coroner will call it a broken heart
So put me in the ground
Put me six foot down
And let the stone say:
Here lies the girl whose only crutch
Was loving one man just a little too much
If you go before I do
I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two
Dig two
Ooh, ooh
I took your name when I took those vows
I meant 'em back then and I mean 'em right now
Oh, right now
If the ties that bind ever do come loose
If forever ever ends for you
If that ring gets a little too tight
You might as well read me my last rights
And let the stone say
Here lies the girl whose only crutch
Was loving one man just a little too much
If you go before I do
Gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig, uh!
Heavy stone right next to mine
We'll be together 'til the end of time
Don't you go before I do
I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two
I told you on the day we wed
I was gonna love you 'til I's dead"

Too soon, but the good lord knows
The reasons why I guess
Sometimes the greater plan is kinda hard to understand
Right now it don't make sense
I can't make it all make sense

"play it again","luke bryan","2014","Country","She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend,
Thinkin', ""No way she ain't got one.""
Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off
She was like, ""Oh, my God, this is my song.
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long.
Sittin' 'round, waitin' for it to come on and here it is.""
She was like, ""Come here boy, I wanna dance.""
'Fore I said a word she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around 'til it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again.""
And I said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again.""
I'd gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later we were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM, too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up
She was like, ""Oh, my God, this is my song.
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long.
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is.""
She was like, ""Come here boy, I wanna dance.""
'Fore I said a word she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again.""
And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again.""
The next Friday night
We were sittin' out under the stars
You should have seen her smile
When I broke out my guitar
She was like, ""Oh my God, this is my song.
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long.
Sittin' 'round, waitin' for it to come on and here it is.""
She was like, ""Come here boy, I wanna dance.""

Yeah, play it again, play it again, play it again

Grabbed all the cash underneath my mattress

Ran into a girl in a pretty white dress
Rolled down a window, where you heading to next?
Said I'm heading to the bar with my money out the mattress

Got a full tank of gas and the money out the mattress

Trusted someone bigger than me

Cowboy boots by your little bare feet

Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans

One of the best nights
That I've had no doubt
Between the bottle of wine

And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love
If I never get to see the Northern Lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man

"when it rains it pours","luke combs","2017","Country","Sunday morning, man,
she woke up fighting mad
Bitching and moaning on and on 'bout the time I had
And by Tuesday, you could say that girl was good as gone
Then when Thursday came around,
I was all alone
So I went for a drive to clear my mind,
ended up at a Shell on I-65
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch off ticket
Bought two twelve packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waist of time,
oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number 5 on a radio station,
won a 4-day, 3-night, beach vacation
Deep sea, senorita,
fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my ex future mother-in-law anymore
Oh lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours
Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
When she heard about my new found luck on that FM dial
And it's crazy how this now just seems to come in when
What I thought was gonna be the death of me was my saving grace
It's got me thinking that her leaving is the only logical reason
That I got the last spot in the Hooter's parking lot
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club Raffle
Won a used four-wheeler and three free passes
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
And I ain't gotta see my ex future mother-in-law anymore
Oh lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours
Well I've been on a hell of a redneck road for three weeks now
And it all started on the day that she walked out
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch off ticket
Bought two twelve packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waist of time, oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number 5 on a radio station, won a 4-day, 3-night, beach vacation

Wouldn't touch me even if you could
But you was sneaking out your window every night
Riding shotgun in my car

And probably went a little too far
Just a little too far

You were gonna be my wife
We didn't know any better
Didn't have a clue about life
But I was what you wanted
you were what I needed

So you went off to college and I got a job
I was working that nine to five
Dreaming of the days when you were in my arms
I have never felt so alive
I spent my days working, spent my nights drinking
Howling at the moon
Screaming for the days when you were coming back
No couldn't come too soon
Couldn't come too soon

You were gonna be my wife
But you went off to find better
And I was learning all about life
But I was what you wanted and you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story
This town had ever seen
So you came back after a long four years
Your college boyfriend didn't work out
So we went out for a couple of drinks
To find out who we are now
Sure we changed but way deep down
You had the same old feelings for me
So I went to the store and I bought you a ring
and I got down on one knee
Got down on one knee
And I said
I am gonna be your forever
So baby will you be my wife
Now that we know a little better
We could have a real nice life
Cause I'm what you wanted and your what I need

It happens every time
It's nothing you

Just did something to me

I can hang with anybody
I can drink whiskey and red wine
Champagne all night
Little Scotch on the rocks and I'm fine, I'm fine
But when I taste tequila, baby I still see ya
Cutting up the floor in a Serotta t-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya, when I taste tequila
When I taste tequila
I can kiss somebody brand new and not even think about you
I can show up to the same bar
Hear the same songs in my car
Baby, your memory it only hits me this hard
When I taste tequila, baby I still see ya
Cutting up the floor in a Serotta t-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya, when I taste Tequila
When I taste Tequila
I ain't even drunk, I ain't even drunk
And I'm thinking
How I need your love, how I need your love
Yeah, it sinks in
When I taste tequila, baby I still see ya
Serotta t-shirt, the same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle

And ends with a wine
Takes forever to get ready 
So she's never on time for anything
But she gets that comb
Get me that look in her eye
Well it kinda scares me 
The way that she drives me wild
But she drives me wild
Beautiful, crazy
She can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances
Ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy 
But her crazy's beautiful to me
She makes plans for the weekend
Can't wait to go out
Till she changes her mind
Says: let's stay on the couch and watch TV
And she falls asleep
Beautiful, crazy
She can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances
Ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy 
But her crazy's beautiful to me
She's unpredictable, unforgettable
It's unusual, unbelievable
How I'm such a fool
Yeah I'm such a fool for her
